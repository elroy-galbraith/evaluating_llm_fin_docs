## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Buy
**Confidence:** Medium

NCB Financial Group Limited presents a compelling case for a value investor, albeit with certain reservations that temper a "Strong Buy" recommendation. The company has demonstrated exceptional operational performance, aligning well with several tenets of my investment philosophy.

Firstly, the reported 88% increase in net profit attributable to stockholders and the substantial rise in EPS to $8.11 are indicative of a high-quality business with significant earnings power. This level of growth is truly impressive and suggests effective management and a robust business model. The improvement in key profitability ratios, with ROE rising to 16.14% and ROA to 1.75%, further underscores the company's efficiency in utilizing capital and assets to generate returns.

Secondly, the improvement in the cost-to-income ratio to 71.87% demonstrates management's ability to control expenses relative to revenue growth, even while making strategic investments in digital capabilities. This operational discipline is a hallmark of well-run businesses. The diversified revenue streams across banking, investment, and insurance activities provide resilience and reduce reliance on any single segment, which is a positive for long-term stability. Strong deposit growth also reflects customer confidence and a stable, low-cost funding base, which is crucial for a financial institution.

However, there are notable concerns that prevent an unreserved endorsement. The 6% decline in equity attributable to stockholders of the parent, primarily due to significant unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio from rising interest rates, is a material concern. While these are unrealized losses and market-driven, they impact the book value and highlight the sensitivity of the balance sheet to interest rate fluctuations. A truly resilient business, in my view, would ideally be less susceptible to such significant swings in its equity base.

Furthermore, while the company operates within the "Caribbean financial ecosystem," the analysis does not explicitly detail the durable competitive advantages or "economic moats" that would ensure its long-term dominance and protect its profitability from competition. While diversification and strong customer deposits hint at some advantages, a clearer articulation of these moats would provide greater comfort. The reliance on "one-off gains" from property sales for a portion of other operating income is also a minor detractor, as I prefer recurring, predictable revenue streams.

Despite these concerns, the overwhelming evidence of strong operational performance, significant earnings growth, and improved efficiency suggests that NCB Financial Group is a well-managed business that is compounding wealth. The decline in equity, while impactful, is largely a market valuation issue for its investment portfolio rather than an operational failure, and the underlying earning power remains strong. The non-declaration of an interim dividend could be a prudent capital allocation decision for reinvestment into the growing business, which aligns with a long-term compounding strategy.

Considering the strong fundamentals and growth trajectory, the company appears to be a good business. The balance sheet concern and the less-than-explicit moat prevent a "Strong Buy," but the positives outweigh the negatives for a long-term investor.

### Key Strengths

- Exceptional net profit growth (88% attributable to parent stockholders).
- Significant improvement in key profitability ratios (ROE to 16.14%, ROA to 1.75%).
- Improved operational efficiency demonstrated by a lower cost-to-income ratio (71.87%).
- Strong revenue growth across diverse segments (banking, insurance, payments).
- Improved asset quality with a reduction in non-performing loans and NPL ratio.

### Key Concerns

- Decline in equity attributable to stockholders of the parent (6%) due to significant unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio from rising interest rates, impacting book value.
- Reliance on 'one-off gains' from property sales contributing to other operating income, which is not sustainable.
- Increased operating expenses, particularly in professional fees and credit card rebates, requiring careful monitoring for long-term efficiency.
- No interim dividend declared, which could signal a need to conserve capital or management's view on future reinvestment opportunities versus shareholder returns.
- The 'Caribbean financial ecosystem' claim needs more concrete evidence of durable competitive advantages (economic moats) beyond general market growth.

### Key Risks

- Interest Rate Risk: Continued rising interest rates could further erode fair value reserves and equity, impacting book value and potentially future profitability from the investment portfolio.
- Economic Moat Uncertainty: The absence of a clearly defined and durable competitive advantage could expose the company to increased competition and limit long-term compounding potential.
- Non-Recurring Income: Reliance on one-off property sales for 'other income' is not sustainable and could lead to volatility in future earnings.
- Operational Expense Creep: While strategic, the increase in professional fees and credit card rebates needs careful monitoring to ensure long-term efficiency is maintained.
- Regulatory/Geopolitical Risk: Operating in the Caribbean financial ecosystem may expose the company to specific regional regulatory changes or economic instability.

## Executive Summary

## Executive Summary

Our initial review of NCB-Financial-Group-Limited's unaudited financial results for the nine months ended June 30, 2022, reveals a business demonstrating significant operational momentum and impressive short-term profitability growth. However, a deeper look through the lens of a long-term, value-oriented investor like Warren Buffett necessitates a nuanced perspective, particularly concerning the durability of competitive advantages and the stability of capital.

**Key Strengths from a Value Perspective:**

The Group has delivered **exceptional earnings growth**, with net profit attributable to parent stockholders surging by 88% to $18.6 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) rising substantially to $8.11. This robust growth is a testament to strong operational performance and effective leverage of revenue increases. Profitability metrics have also seen significant improvement, with **Return on Equity (ROE) improving to 16.14% and Return on Assets (ROA) to 1.75%**. These figures suggest a more efficient deployment of capital and assets, which is a positive indicator of management effectiveness. The **cost-to-income ratio improved to 71.87%**, demonstrating better cost control relative to revenue generation, even amidst strategic investments in digital capabilities. Revenue growth was broad-based, with strong contributions from both banking & investment and insurance activities, indicating a diversified and resilient operating model within the "Caribbean financial ecosystem." Management's focus on digital transformation and revenue stream broadening aligns with efforts to strengthen the business for future growth.

**Areas Requiring Deeper Scrutiny (Buffett's Concerns):**

Despite the strong operational performance, several aspects warrant careful consideration for a long-term investor. Most notably, **equity attributable to stockholders of the parent decreased by 6% ($9.8 billion)**. This decline was primarily driven by a significant $35.1 billion decrease in fair value reserves due to unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio, a direct consequence of rising interest rates. While partially offset by retained earnings, this erosion of book value due to market fluctuations is a material concern for a financial institution, impacting the base from which wealth can compound over decades.

Furthermore, while overall operating income growth was strong, some "other income" benefited from **one-off gains related to property sales**. Such non-recurring revenue streams are not indicative of sustainable core business performance and should be discounted when assessing intrinsic value. We also note increased operating expenses, particularly in professional fees linked to digital investments and credit card rebates. While some are strategic, their long-term impact on efficiency needs continuous monitoring.

Crucially, for a business to be considered truly high-quality by Buffett's standards, it must possess **durable competitive advantages, or "economic moats."** While the Group operates within a significant regional financial ecosystem and shows diversified revenue, the analysis does not explicitly detail the specific, enduring moats that protect its market share and profitability from competition. Is it a low-cost provider? Does it benefit from high switching costs, a powerful brand, or network effects? This remains an area requiring further investigation to ascertain the long-term compounding potential beyond general market growth. The absence of an interim dividend, while potentially signaling a focus on reinvestment, also needs to be weighed against the decline in equity.

**Conclusion:**

NCB-Financial-Group-Limited exhibits strong operational performance and impressive short-term earnings growth, indicative of capable management and a robust market position. However, the significant decline in equity due to unrealized investment losses presents a material concern regarding balance sheet stability and the long-term compounding of shareholder value. Before considering this a "forever stock," a thorough understanding of the sustainability of its earnings growth, the true impact of market volatility on its capital base, and, most importantly, clear evidence of **durable economic moats** that protect its business from competitive forces, is essential. Without these assurances, the business, despite its current profitability, carries risks that would give a prudent, long-term investor pause.

## Company Overview & Business Model

## Company Overview & Business Model

NCB Financial Group Limited (NCBFG) presents itself as a leading diversified financial services provider operating within the dynamic Caribbean financial ecosystem. From a Warren Buffett perspective, understanding the fundamental business and its enduring competitive advantages is paramount.

At its core, NCBFG operates a comprehensive and commendably diversified business model spanning traditional banking and investment activities, robust insurance services, and growing payment solutions. This diversification across consumer & SME banking, life & health insurance, treasury operations, and payment services is a significant strength, providing multiple avenues for revenue generation and mitigating risks associated with over-reliance on any single segment.

The Group's recent performance underscores the effectiveness of this model. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, NCBFG reported a strong 15% increase in net operating income, reaching $105.6 billion. This growth was broad-based, with banking and investment activities contributing a 9% increase, primarily driven by an impressive 18% rise in net interest income from both securities and loans. Furthermore, net fee and commission income saw a healthy 14% increase, fueled by higher transaction volumes in payment services, particularly credit card usage. The insurance segment demonstrated even more remarkable growth, with revenues soaring by 41%, largely due to strong performance in life and health insurance. This consistent and diversified revenue growth is a positive indicator of a well-managed enterprise.

Profitability metrics further highlight the business's strength. Consolidated net profit surged by 86%, with net profit attributable to stockholders of the parent rising by an even more impressive 88% to $18.6 billion. This substantial increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $8.11 from $4.18 in the prior year is a testament to the business's increasing intrinsic value. The improvement in the cost-to-income ratio to 71.87% from 76.12% demonstrates management's ability to leverage revenue growth and enhance operational efficiency, even amidst strategic investments in digital capabilities and inflationary pressures. The robust Return on Equity (ROE) of 16.14% and Return on Assets (ROA) of 1.75% reflect efficient capital allocation and asset utilization, key characteristics of a high-quality business.

From a management perspective, NCBFG appears to be strategically focused on long-term value creation. Their initiatives, including a digital roadmap, operational optimization, and broadening revenue streams, suggest a forward-thinking approach aimed at enhancing customer experience, improving efficiency, and expanding market reach. These strategic investments, if executed effectively, are crucial for sustaining growth and reinforcing competitive positioning.

Regarding durable competitive advantages, or "economic moats," which are central to our investment philosophy, NCBFG exhibits several promising elements within its operating environment. The strong 11% growth in deposits to $712.2 billion reflects significant customer confidence and suggests potential switching costs for its client base, a valuable asset for any financial institution. The increasing transaction volumes in payment services and credit card usage could indicate a growing network effect or strong brand loyalty in these areas. Furthermore, its scale and diversified offerings across the Caribbean likely create barriers to entry for smaller or new competitors. While the "Caribbean financial ecosystem" provides a fertile ground, the true test lies in the company's ability to maintain and expand these unique advantages against competition. We will continue to scrutinize the concrete evidence of these moats.

The impressive growth in earnings per share and return on equity, coupled with strategic investments for future growth, points to a business with the potential to compound capital effectively over time. While the decline in equity attributable to stockholders of the parent due to unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio is a factor to monitor, the underlying operating business model demonstrates strong fundamentals and a capacity for consistent earnings growth through reinvestment and organic expansion.

## Financial Performance Analysis

## Financial Performance Analysis

NCB Financial Group Limited (NCBFG) has demonstrated a period of robust financial performance for the nine months ended June 30, 2022, exhibiting significant growth across key metrics that would capture the attention of a value-oriented investor like Warren Buffett. The results suggest a business with strong operational momentum, though certain aspects warrant closer scrutiny regarding long-term durability and capital management.

**Exceptional Profitability and Earnings Growth:**
The most striking highlight is the substantial increase in profitability. Consolidated net profit surged by an impressive 86%, with net profit attributable to stockholders of the parent rising by an even more remarkable 88% to $18.6 billion. This translates directly into a significant improvement in Earnings Per Share (EPS), which climbed to $8.11 from $4.18 in the prior year. Such a dramatic increase in earnings power is a strong indicator of a business that is effectively generating value for its shareholders.

This earnings growth is underpinned by a healthy 15% increase in net operating income, reaching $105.6 billion. The growth drivers are diversified, stemming from both banking & investment activities (up 9%) and a particularly strong performance in insurance activities (up 41%). Within banking, net interest income saw an 18% boost, fueled by growth in average earning assets and improved yields, while net fee and commission income rose 14% due to higher transaction volumes, especially in credit card usage. This broad-based revenue expansion across diverse segments (consumer & SME, life & health insurance, treasury, payment services) suggests a resilient business model, though the contribution of one-off gains from property sales to "other income" should be noted as non-recurring.

**Operational Efficiency and Asset Utilization:**
NCBFG has also shown commendable improvements in operational efficiency. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 71.87% from 76.12%, indicating that revenue growth has outpaced the increase in operating expenses. This demonstrates management's ability to leverage growth and control costs, even amidst strategic investments in digital capabilities (reflected in higher professional and consultancy fees) and inflationary pressures.

The Group's Return on Equity (ROE) significantly improved to 16.14% from 8.45%, and Return on Assets (ROA) rose to 1.75% from 1.01%. These metrics are crucial for a long-term investor, as they reflect the efficiency with which the company is utilizing shareholders' capital and its overall assets to generate profit. An ROE of over 15% is generally considered attractive, suggesting effective capital deployment.

**Balance Sheet Health and Capital Management:**
The balance sheet reflects continued growth, with total assets expanding by 7% to $2.02 trillion, driven by increases in net loans and investment securities. Asset quality has also improved, with non-performing loans decreasing by 1% and the non-performing loan ratio declining to 5.3% from 6.0%. This indicates sound risk management and a healthy loan book. Funding remains robust, supported by an 11% increase in deposits, signaling strong customer confidence – a potential indicator of a strong brand and customer loyalty.

However, a notable concern is the 6% decrease in equity attributable to stockholders of the parent, primarily due to a significant $35.1 billion decrease in fair value reserves. This was a result of unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio, driven by rising interest rates. While partially offset by increased retained earnings from improved profitability, this erosion of book value due to market fluctuations warrants close attention, as it impacts the underlying value for shareholders and could affect future capital allocation decisions. The absence of an interim dividend declaration could be interpreted as a prudent measure to conserve capital or a strategic decision to reinvest earnings back into the business for future growth, aligning with a compounding philosophy if the reinvestment yields high returns.

**Strategic Initiatives and Economic Moats:**
Management's focus on a digital roadmap, optimization, and broadening revenue streams aligns with building a more resilient and competitive business. The strong deposit base and improved asset quality could be seen as nascent elements of a durable competitive advantage, or "economic moat," within the "Caribbean financial ecosystem." A strong customer base and effective risk management contribute to stability and potentially lower cost of capital. However, a deeper analysis would be required to definitively identify specific, enduring moats such as significant cost advantages, network effects, or strong intangible assets beyond general market presence.

**Long-Term Compounding Potential:**
From a Warren Buffett perspective, NCBFG's strong and diversified revenue growth, exceptional earnings increase, and improved operational efficiency point towards a business with significant potential for compounding wealth over the long term. The strategic investments in digital capabilities suggest a forward-looking management team focused on organic growth. While the decline in equity due to market-driven fair value adjustments is a short-term headwind, the underlying operational strength and profitability improvements suggest that the core business is performing well and has the capacity to generate substantial free cash flow for reinvestment, provided capital is allocated wisely. The sustainability of the 16.14% ROE and the continued growth in EPS will be key indicators of its long-term compounding ability.

## Management Quality & Strategic Vision

### Management Quality & Strategic Vision

From the perspective of a long-term owner, the quality of management and the clarity of its strategic vision are paramount. In the case of NCB-Financial-Group-Limited (NCBFG), the recent financial results offer compelling evidence of a highly effective management team. The remarkable 88% increase in net profit attributable to parent stockholders, coupled with significant improvements in Return on Equity (ROE) to 16.14% and Return on Assets (ROA) to 1.75%, speaks volumes about management's ability to drive earnings and optimize capital utilization. This level of performance, alongside an improved cost-to-income ratio of 71.87%, demonstrates a strong grip on operational efficiency and a capacity to leverage revenue growth effectively.

Management's strategic initiatives appear well-aligned with fostering long-term value. The focus on a "digital roadmap," "optimization," and "broadening revenue streams" is evident in the diversified growth across banking, investment, and insurance activities. Investments in digital capabilities, while contributing to increased professional fees, are crucial for future relevance and competitive positioning in the evolving financial landscape. Furthermore, the improvement in asset quality, with a declining non-performing loan ratio, highlights prudent risk management – a cornerstone of any well-run financial institution.

A key aspect of our philosophy is identifying businesses with durable competitive advantages, or "economic moats." NCBFG's claim of being a significant player in the "Caribbean financial ecosystem" suggests a strong regional presence. The robust deposit growth, reflecting strong customer confidence, and the diversified revenue streams across various segments (consumer & SME, life & health insurance, treasury, payment services) could indicate elements of customer stickiness and a broad market reach. However, a deeper understanding of specific, enduring moats – such as unparalleled brand loyalty, significant cost advantages, or high switching costs for customers – would be essential to fully confirm a truly unassailable competitive position. Management's vision should articulate how these advantages are being built and defended over time.

Regarding capital allocation, the decision not to declare an interim dividend, while potentially a short-term concern for some, can be viewed through a long-term lens as management prioritizing the reinvestment of earnings back into the business for future growth. This aligns with a compounding strategy, where retained earnings are deployed to generate even greater future profits. However, the 6% decline in equity attributable to stockholders, primarily due to unrealized mark-to-market losses from rising interest rates, warrants close attention. While regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are met, management's strategy for mitigating interest rate risk within its investment portfolio will be critical for protecting book value and ensuring consistent long-term compounding.

In conclusion, NCBFG's management has demonstrated exceptional execution in driving profitability and operational efficiency. Their strategic vision for digital transformation and revenue diversification appears sound, laying a foundation for continued growth. While the presence of a deep economic moat requires further scrutiny, the current management's performance and strategic direction suggest a business with significant potential for long-term compounding, provided they continue to navigate market challenges and reinforce their competitive advantages.

## Investment Recommendation

**Buy**

NCB Financial Group Limited presents a compelling case for a value investor, albeit with certain reservations that temper a "Strong Buy" recommendation. The company has demonstrated exceptional operational performance, aligning well with several tenets of my investment philosophy.

Firstly, the reported 88% increase in net profit attributable to stockholders and the substantial rise in EPS to $8.11 are indicative of a high-quality business with significant earnings power. This level of growth is truly impressive and suggests effective management and a robust business model. The improvement in key profitability ratios, with ROE rising to 16.14% and ROA to 1.75%, further underscores the company's efficiency in utilizing capital and assets to generate returns.

Secondly, the improvement in the cost-to-income ratio to 71.87% demonstrates management's ability to control expenses relative to revenue growth, even while making strategic investments in digital capabilities. This operational discipline is a hallmark of well-run businesses. The diversified revenue streams across banking, investment, and insurance activities provide resilience and reduce reliance on any single segment, which is a positive for long-term stability. Strong deposit growth also reflects customer confidence and a stable, low-cost funding base, which is crucial for a financial institution.

However, there are notable concerns that prevent an unreserved endorsement. The 6% decline in equity attributable to stockholders of the parent, primarily due to significant unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio from rising interest rates, is a material concern. While these are unrealized losses and market-driven, they impact the book value and highlight the sensitivity of the balance sheet to interest rate fluctuations. A truly resilient business, in my view, would ideally be less susceptible to such significant swings in its equity base.

Furthermore, while the company operates within the "Caribbean financial ecosystem," the analysis does not explicitly detail the durable competitive advantages or "economic moats" that would ensure its long-term dominance and protect its profitability from competition. While diversification and strong customer deposits hint at some advantages, a clearer articulation of these moats would provide greater comfort. The reliance on "one-off gains" from property sales for a portion of other operating income is also a minor detractor, as I prefer recurring, predictable revenue streams.

Despite these concerns, the overwhelming evidence of strong operational performance, significant earnings growth, and improved efficiency suggests that NCB Financial Group is a well-managed business that is compounding wealth. The decline in equity, while impactful, is largely a market valuation issue for its investment portfolio rather than an operational failure, and the underlying earning power remains strong. The non-declaration of an interim dividend could be a prudent capital allocation decision for reinvestment into the growing business, which aligns with a long-term compounding strategy.

Considering the strong fundamentals and growth trajectory, the company appears to be a good business. The balance sheet concern and the less-than-explicit moat prevent a "Strong Buy," but the positives outweigh the negatives for a long-term investor.

### Valuation Commentary

Without specific valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or Price-to-Book (P/B) ratios, a precise price target cannot be established. However, the significant improvement in Earnings Per Share (EPS) to $8.11 and the robust Return on Equity (ROE) of 16.14% indicate that the company's intrinsic value is growing at a healthy pace. The decline in equity due to unrealized mark-to-market losses might present a temporary disconnect between the market price and the underlying earning power of the business. A prudent investor should focus on acquiring shares at a reasonable multiple of its consistently growing earnings, ideally below its expanding intrinsic value. The long-term potential lies in the company's ability to continue compounding earnings and, over time, potentially reverse the impact of the fair value reserve fluctuations.
