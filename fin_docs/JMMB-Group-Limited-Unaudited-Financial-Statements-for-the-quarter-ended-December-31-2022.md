GROUP CEO’S COMMENTARY

Strong Despite Market Conditions
The JMMB Group posted solid net profit of J$4.8 billion for the period ending December 31, 2022, despite continued adverse market conditions. The Group continues to successfully execute its diversification strategy and has been reaping the benefits of this from strong contributions to growth and profitability outside of Jamaica and its original flagship investments business line.

As a safe and solid publicly-held company, firmly rooted in its core values and commitment to clients, shareholders, team members and all stakeholders, the Group continues to be adequately capitalized and in compliance with all regulators in its operating territories. In the previous quarter, the Group received an upgrade in its Corporate Credit Ratings from Caribbean Information and Credit Rating Services Limited (CariCRIS) to Cari A- on its regional local currency scale. Additionally, the Group continued to deepen its ongoing strategic partnership with IDB Invest, a member of the Inter-American Development Bank Group, having received additional funding during the period for JMMB Bank Jamaica Limited’s SME solutions suite.

Diversification Strengthens the Group
As experienced across the industry, the high interest rate operating environment continues to impact the performance of the Group’s investments business line in Jamaica and Dominican Republic. The quarter’s financial results therefore reflect this impact particularly earnings from gains on securities trading as well as net interest income, which are both core drivers of earnings and which historically combined account for approximately 61% of total revenue.

While the investments business line has been adversely impacted by the macroeconomic environment, the Group’s banking business line was the largest revenue contributor, accounting for 52% of net operating revenue, up from 37% in the prior period. In terms of geographic contribution, the Group’s regional diversification strategy continued to yield benefits as Trinidad contributed 23% to operating revenue, up from 15% in the prior period. Sagicro Financial Company Limited (SFC) also contributed positively to the Group’s profitability with J$2.12 billion in share of profit.

The JMMB Group remains committed to protecting clients and their goals and is serious about the controls in place to safeguard them which are strengthened on an ongoing basis. Protecting clients’ deposits and investments is a top priority for the Group throughout its operations. The Group’s online banking platform, Moneyline, empowers clients to monitor and manage their solutions. Additionally, system generated statements are emailed and/or mailed directly to

clients who request physical statements and clients are also able to visit branch locations to request statements at any time.

During the reporting period, the Group launched merchant acquiring solutions for business clients including POS and Scan2Pay solutions developed with technology partner WiPay Jamaica Limited. In the coming quarter, the Group will continue to work on other products and digital solutions aimed at deepening partnership and enhancing the experience of both retail and business clients.

Looking Ahead
In continuing to successfully manage performance within the context of a challenging operating environment, the Group has noted the fairly positive signals proffered by the IMF in its January 2023 World Economic Outlook. The Outlook indicates a marginal improvement in the forecast around economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as well as globally in 2023. This, coupled with expectations around falling inflation, likely signal that markets will trend towards gradual normalization as central banks ease their monetary policies. Notably, central banks in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic have paused their rate hikes, while the US Federal Reserve Bank has continued to signal further rate hikes at, however, a slower pace. Importantly, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) has not increased interest rates throughout the high global inflation period.

The Group expects to see improved market conditions over time which could see a gradual easing of monetary policy and thus looks forward to eventual normalized levels of performance especially in its Investments Business Line in the medium term.

In the quarter ahead, the Group will continue to focus on “smart growth” through diversification of earning streams, expansion into new geographies and new business lines, while improving efficiency to drive growth and profitability.

GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Net Operating Revenue

The JMMB Group posted net operating revenue of J$18.90 billion for the nine months ending December 31, 2022, reflecting a decline of 14%. The operating environment remained challenging when compared to the prior period. This stemmed from rising inflation resulting from the war in Ukraine and the attendant increase in geo-political uncertainty, supply chain disruptions as well as other Covid-related factors. Central banks across the world, as a part of their inflation-targeting regime, continued to increase interest rates and reduce market liquidity. This had a particularly negative impact on trading gains.

Trading gains fell by 51% to J$3.49B as, given rising interest rates, investors continued to de-risk resulting in a reduced demand for emerging market assets. Consequently, asset prices fell and trading activity was reduced. This was contrary to the prior period where investor sentiment was high and interest rates were low. Investors were therefore in search of yields and there was high demand for emerging market assets.

Largely, the other major revenue lines increased, in particular, fees and commission income. This was facilitated by increased economic activity as all the Group’s operating territories are in recovery mode. Notably, the Dominican Republic has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Fees and commission income was 16% higher at J$4.32 billion as the Group remain dedicated to ensuring that clients meet their financial life goals. Further, clients continue to

demonstrate confidence in the value of solutions and services as evidenced by the strong growth of the loan and investment portfolios.

</table>

The Banking & Related Services segment contributed J$9.82 billion or 52% of net operating revenue. This represented a 21% increase over the prior period and reflected strong growth in the loan book which translated into increased net interest income. Also, there were higher FX trading gains and fees.

The Financial and Related Services segment contributed J$8.35 billion or 44% of net operating revenue and reflected a decline of 39%. This largely reflected lower trading gains.

Operating Efficiency

Operating expenses moved from J$13.21 billion to J$14.68 billion and reflected inflationary increases as well as strategic spend related to longer-term initiatives aimed at improving the posture and positioning of the Group. Thus, operational efficiency moved from 60% to 78%. Nevertheless, the Group will continue to focus on projects aimed at yielding scale and efficiency and thus contribute to long term shareholder value.

Interest in Associated Company

For the quarter ended 31 December 2022, the Group has not recorded any share of profits from its associated company Sagicor Financial Company Limited (SFC). SFC has opted to publish its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2022, utilising 90 day provision under the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). The results for the quarter were thus not available. The Group will therefore, reflect any earnings from SFC in its fourth quarter ended 31 March 2023.

GROUP FINANCIAL POSITION

Total Assets

At the end of the reporting period, the Group’s asset base totalled J$640.47 billion, up 4% relative to the start of the financial year. This was mainly on account of a larger loan portfolio which grew by 16% to J$165.98 billion. The credit quality of the loan portfolio continued to be comparable to international standards and the Group continues to maintain enhanced monitoring to mitigate against possible deterioration in credit quality.

Growth in the asset base over the nine-month period was funded in part by increases in customer deposits, repos and multilateral funding. Deposits grew by 8% to J$163.60 billion, while repos increased 4% to J$309.66 billion. Further, an additional tranche of funding was received from IDB Invest, a member of the Inter-American Development Bank Group. This funding is earmarked for the SME segment and will improve the capacity of JMMB Bank Jamaica Limited to continue building out its SME solutions suite.

Over the nine-month period, shareholders’ equity decreased by 12% to J$49.53 billion. Despite posting significant profit since the start of year, this was completely offset by a further decline in investment revaluation reserve. For the current reporting period, bond prices and by extension investment revaluation reserve continued to be negatively impacted by rising interest rates, increased global uncertainty, rising commodity prices as well as supply chain disruptions.

Nevertheless, the Group continues to be adequately capitalized and all individually regulated companies within the Group continue to exceed their regulatory capital requirements. The performance of the major subsidiaries is shown in the table above.

Off-Balance Sheet Funds under Management

The Group continued to execute on its strategy to provide complete, customized financial solutions for each client. This include off-balance sheet products such as pension funds, unit trusts and money market funds. For the period under review, congruent with the decline in asset prices globally, assets in these funds were adversely impacted. Consequently, the total invested in off-balance sheet products as at the end of December 2022 stood at J$182.84 billion compared to J$187.38 billion as at end of December 2021.

The JMMB Group in the Community

JMMB Group remains actively and publicly involved in charitable and voluntary activities within the countries in which it operates. During the last quarter, the Group’s efforts were largely focused on educational initiatives, entrepreneurship, transformational training and community outreach.

In Jamaica, the JMMB Joan Duncan Foundation (the Foundation) spearheaded and/or partnered with several organizations to undertake transformational projects and community outreach efforts.

The Joan Duncan Foundation provided over J$750K in financial assistance, towards the Eastern Gazebo Renovation project spearheaded by Nature Preservation Foundation (NPF) at the Hope Royal Botanic Gardens and Hope Zoo. The renovation project is designed to preserve the wide collection of plant species for the purpose of facilitatory research, environmental education, conservation and public recreation spaces.

The Foundation also participated in first community link-up event in Breezy Castle, led by Project Star, a social transformational and renewal programme, undertaken by the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica (PSOJ) in partnership with the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF). This event is a part of efforts to build safer, secure, more prosperous communities which will translate into a sustainable reduction in violence and crime. This is in keeping with the Foundation’s support of national and transformational initiatives, as evidenced by its committed of J$20M towards Project Star.

Through its Share the Love initiative, the JMMB Joan Duncan Foundation distributed 3,000 care packages, valued at J$16.2M, to the elderly, disabled, and other vulnerable individuals affected by food insecurity across the island. This initiative was done in partnership with 30 charities and organizations, to mark the Group’s 30th anniversary.

In addition, the Foundation continues to provide hundreds of individuals and voluntary organizations, who are beneficiaries of the Foundation with transformational training via its Conversations for Greatness app. Furthermore, the Foundation alongside the wider team continues to support a range of community outreach efforts, including the St. Ann Municipal Corporation and United Pentecostal Church.

The team in the Dominican Republic focused its corporate social responsibility efforts on entrepreneurial activities and community outreach. JMMB remains committed to its partnership with UNPHU Emprende, the Entrepreneur division of the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña; providing support and financial advisory services to the entrepreneurs in the programme.

The JMMB team continues to support the nutritional and educational needs of the orphaned children of the Casa Hogar Madelaes and Casa Nuestra Sra. De la Altagracia. Also, the team brought ‘good tidings’, during the Christmas holidays, by joining forces with Don Bosco for an initiative dubbed, “Christmas Lunch for “chiriperos” Children. On the occasion, the JMMB provided the children with toys and meals, as part of the celebration of the Yuletide season.

Over the period, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee in Trinidad & Tobago, undertook largely education-related projects and community outreach activities. The JMMB team sponsored literacy programmes for children in need. Additionally, the team provided refurbished desktops to the Guaco Pastoral Region for primary schools within the community, in a bid to improve access to technology and enhance the teaching and learning experience. Also, in the true spirit of Christmas, the CSR team also catered to the needs of the less fortunate through the donation of blankets to several children’s home over the period and sponsored meal packages for homeless families, in partnership with a religious organization.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of preparation
The Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies as set out in Note 2 and 35 of the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022.

All amounts are stated in Jamaican dollars unless otherwise indicated.

Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and provides the following definition of ‘material’ to guide preparers of financial statements in making judgements about information to be included in financial statements.

“Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.”

The Group does not expect the amendment to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries presented as a single economic entity.

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights of an investee, where there is exposure to variability of returns and the Company can use its power to influence the returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.

Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those of the Group.

The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated profit and loss account.

The Group uses predecessor value (book value) method of accounting for business combinations with entities under common control. Any differences between the consideration paid and the net assets of the acquired entity is recognised in equity.

(i) Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests (NCI) are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

(ii) Loss of control

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interest (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

(b) Interest in associated company
Associated company is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associated company includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition.

3. Earnings per stock unit
Earnings per stock unit (“EPS”) is computed by dividing profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent of J$4,525,656,405 (2021 – J$8,280,434,912) by the weighted average number of stock units in issue during the period, numbering 1,955,552,532 (2021 – 1,955,552,532).

4. Managed funds
The Group acts as agent and earns fees for managing clients’ funds on a non-recourse basis under a management agreement. At 31 December 2022, funds managed in this way amounted to J$182,842,762,611 (2021 – J$187,381,872,106).

5. Comparative Information
Where necessary, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation in the current period.

6. Business Acquisition
In July 2022, JMMB Group Limited received formal approval by the local Regulator for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Banco Multiple Bellbank S.A. (BellBank), and on 24 October, 2022, its merger with our savings and loans bank, Banco Rio De Ahorro Y Credito JMMB Bank S.A. BellBank, a commercial banking operation located in Dominican Republic, was acquired at a cost of approximately US$7.2 million. The merged entity is named Banco Múltiple JMMB Bank, S.A.

The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity has not been consolidated as at 31 December 2022 as the Group is awaiting final approval from the local Regulator arising from its inspection of the merged entity.

The fair value measurement of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (net assets) has not yet been finalized. Management has utilized the provision under IFRS 3 – Business Combinations which allows the acquirer reasonable time to obtain information necessary to identify and measure the assets and liabilities. Management expects that this assessment will conclude before March 31, 2023.
