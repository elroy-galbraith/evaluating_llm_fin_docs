Chairman's Statement

This year saw double-digit growth in both top and bottom line performance. This performance was a direct result of our expenditure in higher capacity machinery, and our renewed push into the export market. We recruited a new Export Sales Manager and issued a number of new distributor contracts in the Diaspora. This enabled export revenues to grow by 40% when compared to the prior year.

As a company, we recognize the importance of having a strategy that is aligned with and adequately prepares us for upheavals in the dynamic markets in which we operate. This year, as part of our vision 2021 plan, I am pleased to say that we successfully completed several of our strategic initiatives. These include the addition of a number of seasoned professionals to our executive team, implementation of service level agreements through our supply chain, in particular, the distribution team, and transformation from shift to line operations. In the coming years, we plan to invest our cash reserves in funding leaner manufacturing and increased automation.

This year, our primary focus was developing our people and engaging them in a culture of continuous improvement and leadership. We recognize that the strength of our people is crucial to our competitive advantage, and as such we implemented several projects and initiatives in this regard. Honey Bun remains committed to becoming the best place to work by 2022.

We have developed the roadmap to meet these objectives and a new three-year strategy. This strategy involves building proficiency of our people, efficiency of our operations and using technology to drive our operations. We are confident that with this approach, we are well positioned to creating leaner manufacturing capabilities, finding and developing new business opportunities, whilst staying true to our corporate social responsibilities and values.

During this Financial year we received the following notable Awards:
• JSE 2018 Best Practice Award for Corporate Disclosure and Investor Relations
• JSE 2018 PSOJ Award for Corporate Governance.

I wish to thank our other Directors for their support over the years as they continue to provide wisdom and support well beyond our expectations.

I also wish to thank all our stakeholders including our dedicated and loyal staff. I wish to specially thank our customers for continuing to choose their local Honey Bun Brands as the brand they can trust.

Donuts for Teachers! Honey Bun fetes 40 schools for Teacher’s Day
Teaching staff across the island to receive complimentary donuts

Honey Bun (1982) Limited, under the guidance of Chief Executive Officer Michelle Chong, has set out to truly celebrate and encourage educators across Jamaica with its great tasting donuts.

The initiative dubbed Donuts for Teachers, launched on Teacher’s Day, Wednesday May 8, 2019 at Rousseau Primary School saw teaching staff indulging in fresh-from-the-oven donuts treats. John Mills Infant, Primary and Junior High School was also among the 40 schools, in all five education zones across Jamaica, to receive treats. The freshly baked donuts were presented in brand new packaging, which they were the first set of individuals to receive, making it even more special.

“We are sending these boxes of donuts as a small gift for the unwavering servitude and contribution of teachers to the talent pool of our children providing hope for a great Jamaican future,” noted Chong in her Teacher’s Day message.

“For it is from you (teachers) that our children’s first passions are born. It is from you (teachers) nurturing their creative skills that we have such unique set of talent here in Jamaica. At Honey Bun, we like to call it Jamaica’s greatest competitive advantage for it is available nowhere else in the world.” In her message Chong surprised the teachers with the breadth of the gift.

“At Honey Bun, we do not wish to forget where seeds of talents are planted and we want to congratulate, recognise and encourage you each day. We will continue to send you donuts each week until the end of the school year to remind you each time you receive them of how much you are appreciated.”

Honey Bun has already heeded the call of Principal Speid, and has set its sights on extending the treat to the teaching staff in the over 1,200 schools across the island according to Sales Manager Antoinette Morgan-Burt.

“It’s an ambitious activation,” noted Morgan-Burt, “but if you know Honey Bun, we are led by a bold leader with bold ideas and we are up to the challenge. We truly want to show our appreciation for our educators at every school across the island.”

THE Honey Bun FOUNDATION
For SMEs and the Creative Industry

The Honey Bun Foundation was officially launched on Tuesday November 12 at Devon House in St Andrew. The Foundation received tremendous support and endorsements from: Minister of State in the Ministry of Mining, Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries Floyd Green; Managing Director DBJ Milverton Reynolds; the Jamaica Stock Exchange, and a host of others.

The Mission of The Honey Bun Foundation is ‘To build powerful models for SMEs and the Creative Industry to become transformational industries for Jamaica’s economy’. This was clearly expressed by the Foundation’s Founder Michelle Chong who gave a moving speech on the inspiration behind the Foundation, and General Manager Nashauna Lalah who delivered the night’s welcome and opening remarks. The launch was attended by members of the private and public sectors including key representatives of agencies and industries with whom the Foundation will partner to deliver value to those it serves.

Management Discussion

This year saw us expanding our production lines and overall production area. The increased capacity brought down manufacturing costs, allowing us to register gross margins of 48.2% compared to 45.6% in the prior year. Strategic renegotiation and restructuring of our operating expense drivers, in particular, lease and distribution arrangements, translated to improved net profit margins. Net profit margins closed at 10.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
This year saw cash on hand increase by $93.2 million, closing the year at $192.8 million. Our trade receivables fell by $12.2 million or 21% compared to the prior year to close at $46.3 million, a direct result of improved credit and customer relationship management. Inventory on hand, consisting primarily of raw and packaging materials, grew by $20.7 million or 50%, to close at $62.6 million, and was increased to support our growing product demand.

The company purchased $79.6 million worth of additional property plant and equipment in the year. At the end of the year, total non-current assets stood at $605.2 million.

Corporate Governance
At Honey Bun we continually improve on our corporate policies which are available on our company website. We consider that our Corporate Governance programs improve trust and relationships with all our stakeholders and contribute to financial success.

Future Plans
In 2019, we created our new Buccaneer Jamaica pocket size Rum Cakes in three flavors, Original, Coconut and Fruit. These products were part of our strategy for the export market, and drove the 40% year over year increase in export.

In July 2019, we successfully registered The Honey Bun Foundation. The Foundation’s primary goal is to develop powerful business models for small and medium sized enterprises. We expect to see tremendous accomplishments from the Foundation in our next year’s statement!

This year also saw us engaging the services of a renowned Global Strategist in helping to transform our company culture and performance. The six month long engagement, culminated in our defining and declaring the Honey Bun 3.0 transformational strategy. Our focus moving forward is to continuously build on our capacity, improve on our efficiencies and continue to invest in our people and technology, recognizing they are the pillars of our growth. The coming year will see the company looking at new and exciting business development opportunities.

THIS YEAR SAW CASH ON HAND INCREASE BY $93.2 million CLOSING THE YEAR AT $192.8 million...

We have audited the financial statements of Honey Bun (1982) Limited ("the company"), set out on pages 8 to 47, which comprise the statement of financial position as at September 30, 2019, the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as at September 30, 2019, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
HONEY BUN (1982) LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the Appendix to this auditors’ report. This description, which is located at pages 6 to 7, forms part of our auditors’ report.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act in the manner required.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
HONEY BUN (1982) LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ report

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
HONEY BUN (1982) LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ report (continued)

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

HONEY BUN (1982) LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements
September 30, 2019
(Expressed in Jamaica dollar unless otherwise stated)

1. Identification

Honey Bun (1982) Limited ("the company") is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica, with registered office located at 26 Retirement Crescent, Kingston 5, Jamaica. The company has been listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) since June 3, 2011.

The principal activities of the company are the manufacture and distribution of baked products to the local and export markets.

2. Basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance:

The financial statements as at and for the year ended September 30, 2019 (the reporting date) are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

New and amended standards that became effective during the year

Certain new and amended standards that were in issue came into effect during the current financial year. This is the first set of the company's annual financial statements in which IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, have been applied from October 1, 2018. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 3.

New and amended standards issued that are not yet effective

At the date of approval of the financial statements, there were certain new and amended standards and interpretations to existing standards which were in issue but were not yet effective and which the company has not early adopted. Those which management considered may be relevant to the company are as follows:

• The company will adopt IFRS 16, Leases, effective October 1, 2019. IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. Entities will be required to bring all major leases on-balance sheet, recognising new assets and liabilities. The on-balance sheet liability will attract interest; the total lease expense will be higher in the early years of a lease even if a lease has fixed regular cash rentals. Optional lessee exemption will apply to short- term leases and for low-value items with value of US$5,000 or less.

Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice as the lessor will continue to classify leases as finance and operating leases.

2. Basis of preparation (continued)

(a) Statement of compliance (continued):

New and amended standards issued that are not yet effective (continued)

• IFRS 16, Leases (continued)

The company plans to apply IFRS 16, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balances of retained earnings as of October 1, 2019 with no restatement of comparative information.

• Amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, effective retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 clarifies the treatment of:

(i) Prepayment features with negative compensation:

Financial assets containing prepayment features with negative compensation can now be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) if they meet the other relevant requirements of IFRS 9.

(ii) Modifications to financial liabilities:

If the initial application of IFRS 9 results in a change in accounting policy arising from modified or exchanged fixed rate financial liabilities, retrospective application is required, subject to particular transitional reliefs. There is no change to the accounting for costs and fees when a liability has been modified but not substantially. These are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.

• IFRIC 23, Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.

An entity has to consider whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority would accept the tax treatment that is adopted in its income tax filing.

If the entity concludes that it is probable that the tax authority will accept a particular tax treatment in the tax return, the entity will determine taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment included in its income tax filings and record the same amount in the financial statements. The entity will disclose uncertainty.

(a) Statement of compliance (continued):

New and amended standards issued that are not yet effective (continued)

• IFRIC 23, Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments (continued)

If the entity concludes that it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted, the entity has to use the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates. The decision should be based on which method provides better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.

• Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and provides a definition of ‘material’ to guide preparers of financial statements in making judgements about information to be included in financial statements.

“Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.”

• Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020. The revised framework covers all aspects of standard setting including the objective of financial reporting.

The main change relates to how and when assets and liabilities are recognised and de-recognised in the financial statements.
– New ‘bundle of rights’ approach to assets will mean that an entity may recognise a right to use an asset rather than the asset itself;
– A liability will be recognised if a company has no practical ability to avoid it. This may bring liabilities on balance sheet earlier than at present.
– A new control-based approach to de-recognition will allow an entity to derecognise an asset when it loses control over all or part of it; the focus will no longer be on the transfer of risks and rewards.

The company is assessing the impact that these new and amended standards and interpretations will have on its financial statements when they become effective.

2. Basis of preparation (continued)

(b) Basis of measurement and functional currency:

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the inclusion of investments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income which are carried at fair value. The financial statements are presented in Jamaica dollars, which is the functional currency of the company.

(c) Use of estimates and judgements:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of, and disclosures relating to, assets, liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the reporting date and the income and expenses for the year then ended. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Judgments made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are discussed below:

(i) Financial assets:

Judgements

For the purpose of these financial statements, judgement refers to the informed identification and analysis of reasonable alternatives, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, and the well-reasoned, objective and unbiased choice of the alternative that is most consistent with the agreed principles set out in IFRS. The key relevant judgements are as follows:

– Applicable to 2019 only:

(1) Classification of financial assets:

The assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding requires management to make certain judgements on its business operations.

(i) Financial assets (continued):

Judgements (continued)

– Applicable to 2019 only (continued):

(2) Impairment of financial assets:

Establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward-looking information into measurement of expected credit loss (ECL) and selection and approval of models used to measure ECL requires significant judgement.

Key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty:

– Applicable to 2019 only:

Allowance for impairment losses:

In determining amounts recorded for impairment of financial assets in the financial statements, management makes assumptions in determining the inputs to be used in the ECL measurement model, including incorporation of forward-looking information. Management also estimates the likely amount of cash flows recoverable on the financial assets in determining loss given default. The use of assumptions make uncertainty inherent in such estimates.

(ii) Net realisable value of inventories:

Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realise. These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the reporting date to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the reporting date.

Estimates of net realisable value also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held.

(iii) Residual value and useful life of property, plant and equipment:

The residual value and the useful life of each asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end, and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. The useful life of an asset is defined in terms of the asset’s expected utility to the company.

3. Changes in significant accounting policies

The company has initially adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers from October 1, 2018. A number of other new standards were also effective from October 1, 2018 but they do not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements.

Due to the transition method chosen by the company in applying IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not generally been restated to reflect the requirements of these new standards.

The effect of initially applying these standards is mainly attributed to the following:

– additional disclosures related to IFRS 9 [see notes 4(o), 4(p) and 24(a)(i)];
– additional disclosures related to IFRS 15 [see note 4(k)].

Except for the changes below, the company has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in note 4 to all periods presented in these financial statements.

IFRS 15, Revenue from Contract with Customers

Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, following a five step model: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer (agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations); Step 2: Identify the different performance obligations (promises) in the contract and account for those separately; Step 3: Determine the transaction price (amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services); Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or service; and Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time.

IFRS 15 also includes disclosure requirements to provide comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers.

The adoption of IFRS 15 did not impact the timing or amount of sales from contracts with customers and the related assets and liabilities recognised by the company. Accordingly, the impact on the comparative information is limited to new disclosure requirements.

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The new standard brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities.

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the company has adopted consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which require impairment of financial assets to be presented separate in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

Additionally, the company has adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2019, but have not been applied to the comparative information.

IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale.

IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.

For an explanation of how the company classifies and measures financial instruments under IFRS 9, see note 4(p).

The following table and explain the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the company’s financial assets as at October 1, 2018. There was no change in the measurement categories for the company’s financial liabilities.

A deferred tax credit of $1,849,862 was recognised on transition to IFRS 9 arising from the increase in impairment allowance on trade receivables and investments.

The impact, net of tax, of transition to IFRS 9 on the opening unappropriated profits and capital reserves at October 1, 2018 is as follows:

3. Changes in significant accounting policies (continued)

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (continued)

Impairment of financial assets

IFRS 9 replace the “incurred loss” model in IAS 39 with an “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognised earlier than under IAS 39.

Transition

For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment losses are generally expected to increase and become more volatile. The company has determined that application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at October 1, 2018 results in an additional allowance for impairment as follows:

Trade accounts receivable:
Loss allowance at September 30, 2018 under IAS 39 21,627,270
Transitional adjustment for trade receivables (note 9) 6,123,151
Loss allowance at October 1, 2018 under IFRS 9 $27,750,421

Investments:
Loss allowance at September 30, 2018 under IAS 39 -
Transitional adjustment for investments (note 6) 1,276,295
Loss allowance at October 1 2018 under IFRS 9 $ 1,276,295

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, except that comparative periods generally have not been restated. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in unappropriated profit as at October 1, 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2018, does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2019 under IFRS 9.

4. Significant accounting policies

(a) Segment reporting:

A segment is a distinguishable component of the company that is engaged either in providing products (business segment), or in providing products within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.

*End of Page 31*

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Segment reporting (continued):

The company’s activities are limited to the manufacture and distribution of baked products to Jamaican and overseas consumers. Overseas revenue is less than 10% of gross operating revenue and not considered a separate segment. No additional segment information is provided.

(b) Property, plant and equipment:

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, except for freehold land and buildings and plant and machinery which are measured at valuation, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of material and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

The market value of freehold land and building is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction considering its existing condition and location. The market value of plant and machinery is estimated using depreciated replacement cost approach. Gains arising from changes in market value are taken to capital reserve in changes in equity. Losses that offset previous gains of the same asset are charged against the capital reserve; all other losses are charged to profit or loss.

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on the straight-line basis at annual rates estimated to write down the assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives. No depreciation is charged on land and construction in progress. The depreciation is charged over the useful life of the assets as follows:

<table>
  <tr><th>Buildings</th><td>40 years</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Furniture and fixtures</th><td>10 years</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Bakery fixtures</th><td>2 to 5 years</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Computers</th><td>4 years</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Motor vehicles</th><td>5 years</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Plant and machinery</th><td>10 years</td></tr>
</table>

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.

(c) Intangible assets:

Computer software:

Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of three (3) years for software on a straight line basis.

Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as expenses as incurred.

(d) Inventories:

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost, determined principally on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling costs.

(e) Trade and other receivables:

Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less impairment losses.

(f) Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank balances and short-term deposits with maturity of three months or less from the date of placement, and are measured at amortised cost. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, bank overdraft, if any, that is repayable on demand and form an integral part of cash management activities, is included as part of cash and cash equivalents.

(g) Trade and other payables:

Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost [see note 4(o)].

(h) Borrowings:

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as property, plant and equipment.

(i) Share capital:
Ordinary shares are classified as equity where there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. Transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds of the share issue.

(j) Dividends:
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are approved.

Interim dividends payable to shareholders are approved by the directors while final dividends have to be approved by the equity shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Dividends for the year that are declared after the reporting date are dealt with in the subsequent events note.

(k) Revenue:
The effect of initially applying IFRS 15 on the company’s revenue from contracts is described in note 3.

Performance obligations and revenue recognition policies:

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The company recognises revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer.

The nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers, including significant payment terms, and the related revenue recognition policies are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type of service</th>
    <th>Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms.</th>
    <th>Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 (applicable from October 1, 2018).</th>

(k) Revenue (continued):

Revenue recognition under IAS 18 (applicable before October 1, 2018)

Revenue from sale of goods represents the invoiced value of goods and services, and is recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or material associated costs on the possible return of goods.

(l) Taxation:

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.

Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences except to the extent that the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(m) Related parties:

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (referred to in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures as the “reporting entity” in this case the company).

(a) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to the company if that person:
    (i) has control or joint control over the company;
    (ii) has significant influence over the company; or
    (iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the company or of a parent of the company.

(b) An entity is related to the company if any of the following conditions applies:
    (i) The entity and the company are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).
    (ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
    (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
    (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.
    (v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the company or an entity related to the company.
    (vi) The entity is controlled, or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).
    (vii) A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).
    (viii)The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the company or to the parent of the company.

(c) Related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged.

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(n) Foreign currencies:

Foreign currency balances at the reporting date are translated at the exchange rates ruling at that date. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of those transactions. Gains and losses arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, all foreign currency gains and losses recognised in profit or loss are treated as cash items and included in cash flows from operating or financing activities along with movement in the relevant balances.

(o) Impairment:

Financial assets

Policy applicable from October 1, 2018

The company recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through OCI.

The company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month ECLs:

- debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- other financial instruments (other than trade receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

The company considers a debt investment security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The company does not apply the low credit risk exemption to any other financial instruments.

12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the company expects to receive).

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(o) Impairment (continued):

Financial assets (continued)

Policy applicable from October 1, 2018 (continued)

Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the company considers reasonable and supportable information relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information.

The company assumes that the credit risk on financial assets has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due.

The company recognises loss allowances for ECLs and considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the company in full, without recourse by the company to action such as realising security if any is held; or
- the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised costs are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the relevant assets.

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(o) Impairment (continued):

Financial assets (continued)

Policy applicable from October 1, 2018 (continued)

Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is the case when the company determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Policy applicable before October 1, 2018

A provision for impairment is established if there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms. The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.

Non-financial assets

The carrying amount of the company’s non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets’ carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(p) Financial instruments:

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In these financial statements, financial assets comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and investments. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and loans.

(i) Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets – Policy applicable from October 1, 2018

The financial assets that meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: a) are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and b) its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as “held to collect” and measured at amortised cost.

Amortised cost represents the net present value (“NPV”) of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:

▪ Cash and cash equivalents
▪ Trade and other receivables
▪ Investments

Due to their short-term nature, the company initially recognises these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses.

(p) Financial instruments (continued):

Subsequent measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in the particular recognition methods disclosed in their individual policy statements associated with each item.

Derecognition

A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

(q) Finance income and costs

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings. Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

(i) Included in trade receivable is $74,503 (2018: $97,332) due from a related party in the ordinary course of business (see note 20).

9. Trade and other receivables (continued)

(ii) Allowances for doubtful accounts were established until September 30, 2018 based on incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts considering aging of balances, the credit history and risk profile of each customer and legal processes to recover accounts receivable. Effective October 1, 2018 such allowances are determined upon origination of the trade accounts receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss ("ECL") of the trade accounts receivable and are recognised over their term.

Under this ECL model, the company uses accounts receivable based on days past due and determines an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 12 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable. A weighted average ECL rate is used as at September 30, 2019 to apply against the accounts receivable balance [note 24(a)(i)].

21. Taxation (continued)

(c) Remission of income tax:
By notice dated 13th August 2009, the Minister of Finance and the Public Service, issued and gazetted the Income Tax (Jamaica Stock Exchange Junior Market) (Remission) Notice, 2009. The Notice effectively granted a remission of income tax to eligible companies that were admitted to the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JMJSE) if certain conditions were achieved after the date of initial admission.

Effective June 3, 2011, the company’s shares were listed on the JMJSE. Consequently, the company is entitled to a remission of income taxes for ten years in the proportion set out below, provided the shares remain listed for at least 15 years.

Years 1 - 5 (June 1, 2011 - May 31, 2016) – 100%
Years 6 -10: (June 1, 2016 - May 31, 2021) – 50%.

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company will have the full benefit of the tax remissions.

24. Financial risk management

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise.

HONEY BUN (1982) LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements (Continued)

(Expressed in Jamaica dollar unless otherwise stated)

24. Financial risk management (continued)

The company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which include interest rate risk and currency risk. This note presents information about the company’s exposure to each of the above risks, the company’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the company’s risk management framework.

The risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the company’s activities. Management standards and procedures aim to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

(a) Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises principally on trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and investments. There is no significant concentration of credit risk and the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.

(i) Accounts receivable

The company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the company’s customer base has less of an influence on credit risk.

A credit policy has been established under which each customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness. Credit is granted to customers on the approval of management. During the credit approval process, the customer is assessed for certain indicators of possible delinquency. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to the ageing of their debt.

The company does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.

The company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The allowances for doubtful debts are based on the ageing of the receivables and the customer’s ability to pay.

(a) Credit risk (continued):

(i) Accounts receivable (continued)

Expected credit loss assessment as at October 1, 2018

The company allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on the data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and the available press information about its customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.

Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default and are aligned to external credit ratings, where available. Exposure within each credit risk grade and an ECL rate is calculated for the company’s customer based on delinquency status and actual historical credit loss experience.

The company uses an allowance matrix to measure ECLs of trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward looking estimates.

Loss rates are calculated based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off, current conditions and the economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables as at September 30, 2019:

24. Financial risk management (continued)

(a) Credit risk (continued):

(ii) Cash and cash equivalents and investments

The company limits its exposure to credit risk by maintaining these balances with financial institutions which management considered to be stable and only with counterparties that are appropriately licensed and regulated. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured at 12 months expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The company considered that cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk. No impairment allowances were recognised on initial adoption of IFRS 9 and there has been no change during the period.

Expected credit loss assessment for investments as at September 30, 2019

Impairment on investments has been measured on the 12-months expected loss basis. Information about the credit risk and quality of these financial assets are as follows:

(b) Liquidity risk:

Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquid resources to meet its financial liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset at, or close to, its fair value.

There was no change to the company’s exposure to liquidity risk during the year, or the manner in which it measures and manages the risk.

(c) Market risk:

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable limits, while optimising the return on risk.

(i) Currency risk:

Currency risk is the risk that the value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

(i) Currency risk (continued):

The company is exposed to currency risk on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. The main currency giving rise to this risk is the United States dollar (US$).

The company ensures that the risk is kept to an acceptable level by monitoring its risk exposure and by maintaining funds in US$ as a hedge against adverse fluctuations in exchange rates.

Exposure to currency risk:
The company’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows:

Exchange rates as at the reporting date were US$: JS$133.12 (2018: US$1: JS$133.46).

Sensitivity analysis:

A 6% (2018: 4%) weakening of the US$ against the JS would increase profit for the year by $9,835,822 (2018: $4,978,677).

A 4% (2018: 2%) strengthening of the US$ against the JS would decrease profit for the year by $6,557,214 (2018: $2,489,339).

The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is done on the same basis as for.

(c) Market risk (continued):

(ii) Interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rate.

The company minimises interest rate risk by investing mainly in fixed rate instruments and contracting liabilities at fixed rates, where possible. The company’s interest rate risk arises mainly from bank loans.

At the reporting date, the interest profile of the company’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for financial instruments:

The company does not account for any interest bearing financial instrument at fair value, therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the carrying value of the company’s financial instruments.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

A change in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

(c) Market risk (continued):

(iii) Equity price risk

Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held by the company as part of its investment portfolio. Management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations. The primary goal of the company’s investment strategy is to maximise investment returns.

A 10% (2018: 10%) increase in the market price at the reporting date would cause an increase in other comprehensive income of $2,207,515 (2018: $1,491,853). A 10% (2018: 10%) decrease would have an equal but opposite effect on other comprehensive income.

(d) Capital management:

The policy of the company’s Board of Directors is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business and ensure it continues as a going concern.

The company considers its capital to be its total equity inclusive of unappropriated profits and capital reserves. The company’s financial objective is to generate a targeted operating surplus, in order to strengthen and provide for the future continuity of the company as a going concern in order to provide returns for its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Directors regularly review the financial position of the company at meetings and monitor the return on capital and the level of dividends to the ordinary shareholders. They seek to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

The company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Debt is the total of long-term loans and bank overdraft less related party loans, if any. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the company’s statement of financial position plus debt. The gearing ratios at the year-end based on these calculations were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2019</th>
    <th>2018</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debt: long-term loans</td>
    <td>23,788,867</td>
    <td>29,783,152</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equity</td>
    <td>740,514,675</td>
    <td>617,870,933</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total capital</td>
    <td>$764,303,542</td>
    <td>$647,654,085</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gearing ratio</td>
    <td>3.11%</td>
    <td>4.59%</td>
  </tr>

(d) Capital management (continued):

During 2019, the company’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2018, was to maintain the gearing ratio below 25%.

There were no significant changes in the company’s approach to capital management during the year and the company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

(e) Fair values

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument. The company’s equities are the only financial instrument that is carried at fair value; also where fair value of financial instruments approximates carrying value, no fair value computation is done.

The carrying values reflected in the financial statements for cash and cash equivalent, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.

The fair value of long-term loans is assumed to approximate carrying value as the loans bear interest at market rates and all other conditions are at market terms.

Quoted equities fair values are based on the bid prices published by the Jamaica Stock Exchange Determination of fair value and fair values hierarchy

IFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments on exchanges.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes financial assets with fair values based on broker quotes.

Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.

The company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.

Apart from the quoted shares which are classified as level 1, the other investments are level 2 investments.
