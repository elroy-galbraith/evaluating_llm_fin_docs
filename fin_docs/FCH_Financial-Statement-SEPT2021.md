2. Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

(a) Basis of preparation
Interim financial reporting
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

*End of Page 9*

---

### Page 10

(b) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases. Condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated, except where there are indications of impairment.

(c) Revenue recognition
(i) Interest income
Interest income on financial assets at amortized is recognized in the income statement for all interest-bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price.

(ii) Dividend income
Dividends are received from financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Dividends are recognized in the condensed consolidated interim income statement when the right to receive payment is established.

(iii) Rental income
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of rental and maintenance charges. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group currently does not provide incentives to its tenants.

The Group assesses the individual elements of the lease agreements and assesses whether these individual elements are separate performance obligations. Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, and/or lease and non-lease components, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation (lease and non-lease component) based on the stand-alone selling prices. These selling prices are predominantly fixed price per the agreements where the tenant pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule.

Revenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract. The Group currently does not have arrangements that include deferred payment terms.

A receivable is recognized when services are provided as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

### Page 11

(d) Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the company’s functional currency. The company has determined that the US dollar its functional currency as its strategy is to contract with multinational entities (mainly US based), at rates consistent with rates charged in the US and therefore considers the US economy to the be primary economy to which it is exposed and the economy that determines the pricing of its goods and services. The largest portion of the company’s revenues, expenses and cash flows are denominated in United States dollars.

(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing exchange rate. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the dates of the transactions and unrealized foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in profit or loss.

(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;
• Income and expenses for each condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
• All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

(e) Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies in the consolidated Group, is classified as investment property. Investment property also includes property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property.

Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.

*End of Page 11*

---

### Page 12

Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be measured at fair value.

Investment property under construction is measured at fair value if the fair value is considered to be reliably determinable. Investment properties under construction for which the fair value cannot be determined reliably, but for which the Group expects the fair value of the property will be reliably determinable when construction is completed, are measured at cost less impairment until the fair value becomes reliably determinable or construction is completed - whichever is earlier.

Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for differences in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. The fair value of investment property reflects, among other things, rental income from current leases and other assumptions market participants would make when pricing the property under current market conditions. Fair value may also be determined using recent comparable sales, with appropriate adjustments for size, location, condition etc, as appropriate. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the cost of the replacement is included in the carrying amount of the property, and the fair value is reassessed.

Changes in fair values are recognized in profit or loss. Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed of. Where the Group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in profit or loss within net gain/(loss) from fair value adjustment on investment property. If an investment property becomes owner occupied, it is reclassified as property, plant and equipment. Its fair value as at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Where an investment property undergoes a change in use, such as commencement of development with a view to sell, the property is transferred to inventories. A property’s deemed cost for subsequent accounting as inventories is its fair value at the date of change in use.

(f) Investments and other financial assets and liabilities
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity in another entity.

Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets comprise loans receivable, and investments at FVPL and at amortized cost, trade and other receivables, due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents balances.

Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise loans, preference shares, trade payables and other liabilities and due to related parties. They are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

*End of Page 12*

### Page 13

Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at FVPL; and
• those to be measured at amortized cost.

For assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses will be recorded in profit or loss. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for them at FVPL. The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Debt instruments
The Group classifies its debt instruments at amortized cost. These are assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent SPPI and are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separately and form part of profit or loss.

Equity instruments
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. These fair value gains and losses are recognized in net change in fair value of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss.

Impairment
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL associated with its debt instruments and loans receivable carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables. The ECL in relation to trade receivables is immaterial.

Debt investments and other instruments are considered to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. The impairment charge for debt investments was assessed and is recorded in profit or loss.

*End of Page 13*

### Page 14

(g) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment provision. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows.

(h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which is assumed to approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.

(i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. If such subsequent cost relates to a replaced part, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives at annual rates, as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Billboards</th>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Right of Use Asset</th>
    <td>Life of lease</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Leasehold improvements</th>
    <td>Life of lease</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Furniture, fixtures & equipment</th>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized in the income statement.

(j) Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

### Page 15

(k) Management fees
A management fee of two per cent (2%) of the net asset value of the Group based on the Group’s audited financials will be paid quarterly to the Group’s management company First Rock Capital Resource Limited.

The fee is to be paid in arrears, based on the quarterly unaudited financial statements of the Group, subject to the ‘claw-back’ provision.

(l) Performance based fees
A performance based cumulative annual dividend calculated as twenty-five per cent (25%) of the audited annual total comprehensive income of the Group in excess of eight per cent (8%) (the ‘hurdle’ rate).

Dividends are to be paid quarterly in arrears, based on the quarterly unaudited financial statements of the company, subject to the ‘claw-back’ provisions.

(m) Operating expenses
Expenses include management, legal, marketing, professional, property maintenance and other fees. They are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred on an accrual basis.

(n) Income taxes and deferred taxes
Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity - in which case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.

The current income tax charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position in the countries where the Group operates. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
