2023 UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT

Financial Performance

Berger Paints Jamaica Limited (BPJL) recorded revenues of JA$718M which was on par with the JA$719M in Q1 2022. However, as reported during financial year 2022, higher costs of raw material and supply chain costs continue to negatively impact cost of goods and gross profit margins in 2023. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in Q1 2023 was JA$407M or 3% more than the JA397M recorded in Q1 2022. This increase in cost is despite sales volumes in Q1 2023 being 6% less than Q1 2022. The consumer demand across the Hardware network and Retail Channel has been lower than the prior year. However, volumes in Automotive and Projects have recorded strong growth of 21% and 12% respectively over the prior year Q1 2022.

Production volumes in Q1 2023 have increased by 6% over Q1 2022 due to focus on improving internal efficiencies. We anticipate further improvements as our new filling equipment is due to be installed and commissioned in Q2 2023. Manufacturing and Operating expenses for Q1 2023 totaled JA $354M compared with JA$304M in Q1 2022, an increase of $51M or 17%. The increases were related to repairs and maintenance, charges related to technical support from our sector and head offices inclusive of the cost for upgrading of Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) and implementation of our new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. These costs are all geared towards delivering an improved performance in 2023.

Based on the factors outlined above, BPJL recorded a loss of JA$39M compared to profits of JA$23M in Q1 2022. We expect that over the next two quarters, additional charges may be incurred as this is necessary to improve our operations and performance for the long-term future. We are confident that our strong Balance Sheet will support this growth agenda.

Outlook

We are confident that the measures being implemented now will deliver on the long-term strategies developed. We continue to manage risks to the business and as the economy continues to show signs of recovery and we stand ready to support our loyal customers, business partners and stakeholders.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management of Berger Paints Jamaica Limited, a heartfelt thank you to our loyal customers, dedicated staff, suppliers, and all other stakeholders for your ongoing and continued support.

On behalf of the Board

Adam N. Sabga
Chairman
