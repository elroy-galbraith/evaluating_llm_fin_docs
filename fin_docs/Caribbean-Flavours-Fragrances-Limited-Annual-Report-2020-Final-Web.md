Chairman’s Report

My Fellow Shareholders

The year 2020 was a very testing and challenging year for business given the many issues that have arisen as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Economies around the world have suffered in many ways as a result of the reduction in demand for products, logistics issues, shortages of raw materials and reduced working hours due to the many restrictions that have been imposed by countries due to the pandemic. Many of the smaller businesses that we serve have been forced to close their doors permanently whilst others continue to operate at a reduced scale.

Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited has been very fortunate having achieved its best financial year, as well as accomplished many firsts despite the pandemic and the many global challenges. Despite Covid-19 and the contraction of global and local markets, we were able to record significant improvements in our operational performance, as well as take the time to invest in the improvement of the physical plant. In seeking new ways to become more innovative and efficient and to diversify our product offerings, the Company was able to respond in a nimble manner by developing and marketing its own hand sanitizer as a response to the overwhelming need seen in the local market.

In 2018, we invested heavily in FlavorFit, a sugar reduction solution that we had promoted and brought to market in response to the public policy goal for sugar reduction in beverages sold to the general public and in schools. Although the Government of Jamaica projected stringent fast-track implementation and strict enforcement of the policy, enforcement in the schools and general marketplace lags way behind with only a handful of beverage manufacturers producing reduced sugar drinks. The Company wrote off approximately J$20 million in inventory of FlavorFit as a result of the expiry of the base raw materials.

CFF has recorded its best financial performance for the year ending December 31, 2020. Revenue for the year was J$593.793 million, an improvement of 28.39% compared to the previous year J$462.462 million.

This result was due primarily to four factors:

1. Increased demand by the market for ginger-based products
2. Increased demand for cleaning agents as a response to the pandemic
3. Development of the Company’s hand sanitizer to meet market demand
4. Exceptional one-off special orders

Despite Covid-19 and the contraction of global and local markets, we were able to record significant improvements in our operational performance, as well as take the time to invest in the improvement of the physical plant.

The gross profit reported for the year was J$190,581 million, an improvement of 36.95% as compared to the J$139,160 million of the previous year ending 31 December 2019. Significant price increases from our suppliers, as well as increased logistics costs negatively impacted our pricing during the period under review. Notwithstanding, stringent and vigilant cost monitoring and containment mediated the impact on the financial results. The net profit before tax reported for the year was J$96,512 million reflecting an improvement of 162.21% as compared to the J$36,807 million reported for the previous year.

At CFF, we are committed to constantly seeking new ways to become more innovative, efficient and agile with the ability to diversify our product offerings and our markets. We continue to build on small successes in the export segment of the business and expect this to improve as markets reopen. We will continue to strive to provide new quality products at world class standards, always at the best quality and competitively-priced. The Company was also recertified during the year with the Safe Quality Food Certification (SQF), the hallmark for quality in our sector.

The Board wishes to thank our dedicated management team and employees for their commitment and dedication during this year, as well as our shareholders, customers and other key stakeholders for their continuous support. We continue to expand our business and live by our motto to 'Tease the Senses'.

Directors’ Report

The Directors of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited present their report for the twelve (12) month period ended December 31, 2020, to all our shareholders. This report outlines many of the major accomplishments and achievements of this Company for this financial year since our historical listing on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange in October 2013.

We are extremely proud of our financial and operational accomplishments given the many challenges experienced during this global pandemic, including logistics, raw materials shortages, restricted work hours due to the government imposed Covid-19 protocols and the closure of schools, all which impacted and reduced the demand for raw materials by many of our customers. However, despite these many challenges, the strategic and focused approach implemented by the Board and Management was evident given the performance and financial outturn for this financial year.

The Statement of Comprehensive Income shows revenue of J$593.753 million, Gross Profit of J$190.581 million and profit before tax of J$96.512 million. Given that the Company is in its second year of the last five years of the Junior Market tax incentive programme, taxation of J$14.213 million was paid on profits reported for this reporting period. Dividends totaling J$22.48 million were also paid out to shareholders during this reporting period.

During this financial period, our Company made major strides in the areas of:
• Increased our exports of fragrances and flavours to many of our customers within the region.
• Continuous retooling and upgrades to our Manufacturing plant thereby increasing capacity.
• New product development and availing The Jamaica Bureau of Standards grade hand sanitizers to the market in a commercial way.
• Successfully achieved Safe Quality Foods recentification

Many of the negative impacts from the global pandemic have been converted into opportunities for our Company during this financial year. Innovations and first mover advantage continue to be one of our critical success factors and this continued throughout the reporting period.

Given that we are a science-based organization, and whilst Covid-19 restricts travelling, our training was switched to online learning and the development of our teams was greatly intensified.

We ensured that most opportunities presented were capitalized on, while working closely with our supply chain partners to ensure that raw material delays were minimized and that the scheduling of staff was effectively done thereby minimizing the possibilities of Covid-19 spread and infection amongst the team. Our Team did exceptionally well during a particularly challenging period for the economy.

We continue to work closely with our customers within the local and regional markets despite Covid-19 and have expanded our growth in markets such as Suriname and Trinidad. Several of our new developments have been accepted by many of our local partners, and we remain confident that post the Covid-19 pandemic and the reopening of many economies that these developments will filter to our revenue in the short to medium term.

As we evolve, and build our manufacturing capacity and efficiencies, the continuous improvement in our Research and Development capabilities remains paramount. Given that we are a science-based organization, and whilst Covid-19 restricts travelling, our training was switched to online learning and the development of our teams was greatly intensified.

The Board will continue to provide the desired policy directions and oversight thereby ensuring that we deliver what we promise to our customers and make the necessary policy changes given the new operating environment. Our customers and suppliers are assured that we will not only meet, but also exceed their expectations, as we continue our journey to provide quality products to new and existing customers.

The Directors of the Company as at December 31, 2020 are Messrs.
• Howard Mitchell
• Anand James

• W. “Billy” Heaven
• Carlton Samuels

Management Discussion and Analysis

The management of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited (CFF) are responsible for the presentation and integrity of the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020, should be read in conjunction with the MD&A for the reader to gain full clarity of CFF’s results.

2020 Overview
2020 was a year which proved to be beyond our greatest expectations as CFF had its best year on record with no low periods. This was achieved during a time when the world ‘shut down’ for nearly three (3) months and had several restrictions on movements and actions which could be executed during the year. The team at CFF rose to the occasion and ensured that customers not only had a consistent supply of our products, but that we were able to provide new products such as hand sanitizers to the local market when there was a market shortage.

Year in Review
Jamaica’s economic fortunes from fiscal prudence and attractive economic headwinds left many to believe that 2020 was going to be a year where the country would record its strongest year of real GDP growth. Unemployment had reached an all time low of 7.3%. Jamaica had experienced its best year of tourism arrivals on record and the government’s policy stance was becoming more accommodative through the reduction or removal of certain distortionary business costs. However, these conditions which were ripe for prosperous economic development vanished as the first confirmed case of the Corona Virus was identified on March 10 - this sent the country into a panic.

Numerous business deals and events were being cancelled and frantic consumers scrambled to stock up on any essential items including cleaning products and food for the upcoming measures which were to be implemented in the coming weeks. This perfect storm dragged not only the financial markets into disarray but also pushed Jamaica to its darkest financial hour in its modern history.

Although this was a time of survival for many companies, CFF activated its business continuity plan and held committee meetings to discuss the Company’s strategy in this environment. Apart from instituting more hygiene protocols, certain members of the administrative staff stayed home to reduce the number of people present in the office at any time. The Company also saw its new reduced sugar product take a disproportionate hit as several manufacturers lost key markets and didn’t need to order these inputs for their processes at the moment.

The IMF has projected that Jamaica’s real GDP should increase by 1.5% in 2021 with several local bodies projecting GDP growth to be well above 6%.

Amid the uncertainties and all of the evolving moments, CFF remained committed to serving Jamaica and many other Caribbean markets. This led to the development of our newest and most innovative product to date which was a liquid hand sanitizer solution. After being developed within a short window, CFF received the necessary approval certification from the Bureau of Standards (BSJ) to deploy the product to the market. As a result of panic buying and hoarding in some cases, alcohol-based products and sanitizer products flew off the shelves at record speed, this caused a problem for health facilities and general businesses which needed to protect staff and customers from the unknown virus. Our hand sanitizer product filled an immediate gap in the market and was extremely well received in the context of a shortage in the country.

CFF also worked with its main customers who pivoted to more stay-at-home goods which were being taken up in high droves by their associated customers. This led to the Company being able to experience all round growth in all of its known business lines. As the economy began to reopen, CFF continued to take a cautious but optimistic stance as the pandemic remained a threat to the country and many businesses. We continue to focus on our export business as we look to diversify our revenue and provide downward protection from any associated fallout in the local market which we serve.

Macroeconomic Environment
Even with global growth slowing and economic activity progressively slowing in Jamaica towards the end of 2019, there was no expectation that 2020 would be the worst year on record for Jamaica, much less the world. Projections were that Jamaica would see an initial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decline of 5.6% by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but the country suffered a 9.9 per cent drop in GDP for 2020. The second quarter saw a 18.4% drop in GDP which is the biggest decline on record. This was in the context that economic activity across several sectors such as hotels and restaurants, transport, storage and communication, manufacturing and other services remained muted for most of the year. Manufacturing saw a 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter with the goods producing sector recording a 0.2% increase for the period. Even with economic activity returning slowly for the remainder of the year, the labour force lost about 74,300 jobs between January 2020 – January 2021 despite the unemployment rate being 8.9%. The Small Business Association revealed that 35 percent of its 300 plus member base had closed their doors permanently. Calendar year inflation was 6.4% with point to point inflation for December 2020 ending at 5.2%. The Jamaican dollar depreciated by 7.60% against the United States Dollar to $142.64 with a new record in August 2020 being set as the JMD eclipsed the $150:US$1:00for the first time.

This economic shock came at a time when the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) was continuing its expansionary fiscal policy which included reducing general consumption tax by 150 basis points to 15%, increasing expenditure on infrastructure across the country, improving public services and Debt to GDP to under 100 per cent once again. The GOJ was divesting more state-owned assets through the Jamaica Stock Exchange which was expanding Jamaica’s investor base which had been relatively flat for decades. GOJ’s budgeted plans had several measures which were meant to improve the formalization of businesses in Jamaica.

The IMF has projected that Jamaica's real GDP should increase by 1.5% in 2021 with several local bodies projecting GDP growth to be well above 6%. The IMF projects that the global economy should increase by 6.0% which should be driven by a 5.1% increase in advanced economies and 6.7% in emerging markets and developing economies. Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to see a 4.6% recovery in GDP as well. A major driver of this will be a successful vaccination campaign along with open borders to facilitate commerce once again. Jamaica isn’t expected to see a proper recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels until 2023 based on the changing environment. Fitch has maintained a B+ rating with a stable outlook for Jamaica at the start of March. This is in conjunction with the government projecting a 0.3% surplus in its 2021 – 2022 budget.

Financial Performance Highlights
Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances is a business which provides key components needed to produce goods for major manufacturing and service-based businesses. This is seen from the Company’s main customers who provide goods consumed daily across the country and provide the fragrances which are used in household and sanitary products. As a research driven company led by the principles of science, CFF serves an approximate market share of more than 60% that continues to benefit from our expanded portfolio of products.

Apart from bulk and small container products sold to small customers, CFF also produces in quantities of 1000 litre containers and other specialized volumes for our largest customers. Despite our business being smaller than the typical medium sized company from our staff compliment, we form a very critical part to the landscape of the local beverage market which can be seen from our revenue base standing above the $450 million mark.CFF is the largest distributor in the region for our affiliate International Flavours and Fragrances which also sees us acting as the regional company in the global representative space. This has been supported by CFF’s Safe Quality Food Certification (SQF) which enables the Company to export anywhere in the world. CFF continues to be regulated and monitored by the Bureau of Standards of Jamaica (BSJ) and The Ministry of Health (MOH).

Despite introducing our FlavorFit product to the beverage market which was expected to comply with the new Ministry of Health Guidelines on sugar content in drinks, the take up of our product was impaired due to the situation which arose from these new measures introduced to combat effects of the virus. Although we had an uptake of the product by some of our manufacturing customers, the take up by their consumers was very lukewarm as they still chose the product with higher sugar content. The other competing businesses within the space didn’t comply with the changes to the guidelines which resulted in an imbalance in the supply chain. Apart from some manufacturers not being prepared for this shift, the non-compliance put them at a disadvantage. This resulted in CFF recording a sizable write down in our inventory related to this product. Even though the market remains lucrative due to the continued push by the MOH and other institutional bodies, the lack of monitoring and compliance of manufacturers limits the reach of this product since our customers have to balance the potential risk from creating these low sugar products for a non-existent market.

CFF had other notable victories in the year which included the renewal of our Safe Quality Food Certification. As a business that is focused on growing our external market space, this renewal proved that CFF is a competent firm in following globally recognized best practices. CFF will continue to be an outlier as we remain one of the few local food based businesses which has taken the necessary steps to compete on a larger international stage.

The Company exports to Barbados, St. Kitts, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Grenada, Suriname, Canada and Dominica. We remain committed to exploring new market opportunities for the new fiscal year.

We continue to take a disciplined approach to our operating model and the implementation of our strategic plan even during the pandemic. Our internal controls continue to be our guide as we deliver quality products in improved response time to our customers. The Board and management remain focused on innovation and new product development, implementation of new strategies geared at customer satisfaction and retention, revenue enhancement, new market penetration and strategic alliances which have created synergies and value. The Company continues to experience stronger revenue growth in various segments of our business due to these drivers even in a global pandemic.

Revenue
Revenue for CFF’s 2020 Financial Year (FY) increased by a staggering 28% to $593.75 million over the $462.46 million reported in 2019. The introduction of the sanitizer during the second quarter combined with the needs by many customers to increase production for some products augured well for top line growth. The second quarter alone saw a 42% rise in our sales when the market shortage for sanitation products was at an all time high. However, the Company’s reduced sugar product performed below expectations and contributed less than was projected and desired.

Gross Profit
Gross profit increased by 37% from $139.16 million to $190.58 million during the 2020 FY. Although commodity prices initially collapsed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our associated costs such as raw materials saw a drastic increase in price such as ethanol. This was further compounded by a surge in external costs as shipping prices and logistic costs which eclipsed general expectations of most global firms. Despite having solid agreements with international partners who we source our key components from, they were unable to absorb these increases in procurement expenses and this is expected to remain at these abnormally high levels as the global supply chain currently remains in a fragile state.

Given these market developments, CFF had no choice but to pass on some of these costs where possible in the future to our customers. We will continue to evaluate same and to take a phased approach in order to ensure that we remain competitive while servicing our customer base. The overall gross profit margin improved from 30% to 32% during this reporting period reported for the period was $29.78 million versus the $13.83 million in the prior financial year.

The Company’s income tax bill jumped from $5.31 million to $14.21 million which was due to the Company’s higher profit before taxation. CFF is now in the second phase of the Junior Market’s 10-year tax remission, the Company benefited from a 50% reduction on its normal taxation rate of 25%. CFF will continue to benefit from the Junior Market tax provision until its 2023 financial year.

Operating Expenses
Total expenses for the 2020 FY amounted to $121.13 million compared to the $111.06 million incurred in the prior year. General depreciation charges related to our right of use asset on our lease and fixed assets increased to $6.35 million and $5.59 million respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for adjustment in cost such as entertainment, motor vehicle expenses, repairs and maintenance and travelling expenses was very evident.

These cost reductions were strategic given that there was the need for a full revision in costs as part of the cost containment strategy which was implemented. The areas which experienced the greatest year-on-year increase were staff costs which grew by 19% to $43.86 million and sanitation which were directly driven by new operating protocols. Apart from the general increase in salaries for members of staff, the Company’s requirement to meet increased demand resulted in more man hours being recorded for the time. The other components of staff costs such as statutory contributions, casual labour, staff welfare and training and travelling allowance saw minimal upwards movement. Staff welfare was deemed to be of the utmost importance during a time when fears were heightened amid the current environment surrounding the pandemic and the necessary assistance was provided

These measures resulted in CFF’s operating profit rising by 157% to $72.31 million for the 2020 financial year. This is the best performance in the history of this Company and we intend to improve on same in the coming years.

Finance Income and Taxes
Net Finance income grew by 178% to $24.21 million due to the Company’s export business bringing in substantial amounts of foreign exchange coupled with the general depreciation of the Jamaican Dollar during the year. Foreign exchange gains

Net Profit
Net profit for the Company totalled $82.3 million representing a 161% rise over the 2019 financial year. This result reflected the outcome of us being able to immediately respond and navigate a crisis successfully. The containment of general expenditure relative to the speed of revenue growth confirmed CFF’s true abilities for a Company with a staff complement of twenty (20). As a result of the Company’s stock split, the adjusted earnings per share for CFF was $0.09 compared to the $0.04 in the prior Financial Year.

Balance Sheet Management
CFF’s total assets grew by 13% to a record $635 million with current assets sharply rising by 14% to $529.08 million. Cash and cash equivalents saw the most improvement as we ended the year 31% stronger at $295.43 million which was invested in mostly US Dollars. Cash at bank and on hand ended the year at its highest levels of $57.23 million, which was a 396% increase over our prior year. Short term deposits closed the period at $238.2 million. This was largely supported by our superior cashflow from operations which stood at $82.14 million. Despite receivables growing by 20% year over year to $79.71 million, the Company’s expected credit loss (ECL) provision remained the same as CFF currently has no lifetime ECL’s. CFF reduced its total inventory on book to $150.72 million as the Company decreased its imported goods for resale while recording a $22.3 million write off of its Flavour-fit products during the year.

Although non-current assets grew by 6% to $105.94 million, the net book value of our core property plant and equipment rose by 23% to $22.73 million.

CFF spent $11.8 million on new additions which included $9.52 million on plant, machinery, furnitures and fixtures.

Total liabilities increased by 9% to $145.02 million as both current and non-current liabilities rose during the year. Non-current liabilities grew by 6% to $87.06 million which consisted mainly of the Company’s recognition of a $3.55 million deferred tax liability during the year along with a remeasurement of our lease liability to $83.51 million. As the Company’s loan with First Global Bank should be fully repaid by August 2021, there was no long-term loan recognition for non-current assets. Current liabilities rose by 14% to $57.96 million which was due to a taxation bill of $9.10 million at the end of the 2020 FY. Otherwise, payables and the current portion of our long-term loan declined to $42.13 million and $2.08 million respectively. The current portion of our lease liability marginally increased to $4.65 million.

Shareholder’s equity soared by 14% to $490 million which was a feature of CFF’s outstanding performance in 2020. The Company made a Dividend payment of 22,480,000 during the financial year to its shareholders whilst the Company’s leverage position stood at a debt to equity ratio of 0.0042 which declined below the 0.01 recorded in the 2019 Financial Year.

Stock Price
Although CFF has performed quite well since our listing on the Junior Market on October 14, 2013, the stock price has not adequately reflected this in the same sense. This has led to CFF being classified as illiquid or as a less appealing option because of the lower comparative gains to be derived from owning the stock. With the top 10 owning 90.40% of CFF with other shareholders owning 9.60%, the CFF board proposed a 10 to 1 stock split to shareholders at our 2020 annual general meeting. This proposal was approved with CFF’s stock splitting effective on October 13 from $18.45 to $1.85. The split was done through the increase of issued share capital of the Company from 89,920,033 to 899,200,330. As a result of this measure, CFF’s stock has traded almost everyday on the market with higher pre-split volumes as more persons become shareholders in the Company.

CFF’s stock ended the year up despite the COVID-19 shock in March which saw the stock hitting a 2 year low of $0.80 ($8.00 pre-split). The stock hit an all time high in October of $3 in a post-split price. Against the comparable indices which all experienced a decline, CFF’s price increased by 7.33% relative to the start and end of 2020.

Since listing in 2013 at $2.25 ($0.23), CFF has returned $1.20 ($0.12) in dividends to shareholders which is a 53% return to investors who purchased at the initial public offering. CFF has paid a consistent $0.25 ($0.025) dividend for the last four (4) Financial Year which equates to a payment of $22,480,000 per year. With a dividend policy of 25%, the Company has maintained its commitment to shareholders to return capital in cash dividends.

Risk Management
The risk management policy framework which has been established by the Board of Directors continues to be a critical part of the daily operations of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited. The management team are the key drivers in the management, operational and enterprise risks within the framework of the policy and are reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. The implementation of various strategies of managing and controlling inventory and cash are reviewed and trends are analysed.

A full evaluation of our risk is performed at every level of operation to ensure that all of the known elements of risk are effectively managed and mitigated. The various enterprise risks are measured and managed, standards are maintained, thorough inspection of raw material inputs and further testing at the completion of the manufacturing process ensures higher levels of standardisation product quality control.

Activities such as receiving of raw materials in our stores; implementation of monthly and full quarterly cycle counts of the inventory; enhancements of the disbursement procedures for fragrances; internal auditing of our cash and cashiers’ daily lodgement; ratio analysis conducted on the monthly and quarterly financial statements have been critical to the effective management of our processes and overall improved business performance.

The requirement for achieving and retaining the Safe Quality Food Certification contributed to the decision to undertake an ongoing audit of our processes and facility, thereby providing effective findings and actionable recommendations for eliminating risks.

In addition to the various reviews being done by the management team, the oversight given by the internal and external audit team serves to focus the Audit Committee in ensuring that our corporate governance objectives for effectively managing risks are met. The areas of insurance and insurable risk are reviewed at all times ensuring that coverage is adequate and reflects the changing nature of the business.

Guided by the findings of both the internal audit and external audit, we continue to benefit from strong internal controls. 2020 saw us having high levels of focus on the areas of cash sales, credit sales, aging accounts receivables and management of the inventory process. The Company maintains key analysis of prevailing exchange rates and increased logistical costs which exist in the prevailing environment.

To ensure shareholder benefits and business continuity in the event of catastrophic occurrences, the implementation of robust internal measures to increase the security of our assets as well as the safeguarding of proprietary trade secrets, customer’s relationship and the data availability and assurance infrastructure have been undertaken.

The Company will continue to manage its risks to protect its employees, assets and the interests of all its stakeholders.

Outlook & Future
Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances has a set of strategic initiatives which will be executed in the 2021 Financial year. One of these items will be to grow our export market as a percentage of our sales but this is dependent on improvement in general logistics movements and the opening up of many economies. CFF wants to increase its exports to at least 10% of sales which will see the company diversifying even at a greater pace, its revenue base. Part of this has already been executed with the Company acquiring a new customer in the fragrance business line. With Derrimon Trading Company Limited having a presence in New York through a specialty supermarket and food distributor, CFF will be utilizing this expanded network and new linkage to reach a broader target market. This synergy with our parent company will allow us to further leverage Derrimon’s distribution network to achieve our core targets.

With our sorrel cordial being a success in 2020, the Company will be continuing with the strategy of extracting unique Jamaican flavours. Jamaica offers a varied selection of unique plants which we believe has value to our overall business. Transforming a seasonal product into a prepared cordial puts the Company in a position to be the main business for our various customers to create new products. Our capacity to extract these flavours through the Scientific Research Council’s verification and research serves as a strong springboard to expand our export business.

We will be expanding our fragrance business through the use of complementary products which has been part of our 5-year strategy. The growth is encouraging and more work will continue in this area to ensure that this area contributes more to the business’ total revenue. The success of our sanitizer product demonstrates that the Company can fully capitalize on a crisis but also provide it as a secondary product to our customers. Though the Company has not revealed the full elements of this strategy, it is something that we intend to explain as needed to shareholders while we build out this plan.

The recovery of the Jamaican economy will depend on a vibrant, open environment where ordinary citizens will be able to get back to ‘normal’. With more of the developed world increasing their vaccination rates past the 50% mark, it is expected that the increased tourism inflows will restore the business activity of Jamaica’s intricate links from the sector. This further extends to the manufacturing and other service sectors which should benefit from a full open environment. This should translate to higher sales as our customers increase their production levels to match strong pent-up demand of the population. Despite the economy opening up at various levels, we expect that our sanitizer product will remain in high demand as persons and businesses maintain higher sanitation standards. COVID-19 has fundamentally shifted the viewpoint of the world especially on the need to for prevention of potential modes of exposure to bacteria and viruses. Due to the continued depreciation of the Jamaican Dollar, increased logistical and supply costs, CFF will pass on these costs to our customers.

We will continue to maintain our focus on research and development which is a critical part of our continued business expansion whilst improving efficiencies and attracting new customers in existing and new markets. As a business with no debt, strong business partnerships and strong capital resources, CFF will be able to navigate not only the COVID-19 pandemic in an even better fashion but will also open new avenues for the business to explore development in other areas. Along with our new business opportunities achieved in 2020, CFF expects to perform at greater levels than last year as the Company continues to surpass the expectations of shareholders.

Corporate Governance

The Board’s overarching responsibility is to ensure that the management and operations of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited (CFF) continue to drive the positive financial trajectory of the Company, resulting in increased shareholder value in the interests of all stakeholder groups. This responsibility is exercised by approval of policies as well as the active monitoring and evaluation of the management practices of the Company, inclusive of decision-making processes.

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way that business is conducted, perhaps irrevocably. Our Board has adapted to many of the changes whilst ensuring that the policy and oversight responsibilities are effectively carried out. The adaptation to changes in the decision making and the way that meetings are held from the usual face to face interactions to the use of digital platforms has been adopted and effectively utilized in the decision-making process of both the Board and all Board Committees. Even with these changes, compliance with Corporate Governance Policies and Framework remains and is given the highest priority. The many constraints imposed by Covid-19 did not deter adherence to the core values upon which Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited was established.

The provision of entrepreneurial leadership, strategic direction and guidance are critical components of long-term corporate viability and success. The Board embraces its roles in creating and maintaining long-term shareholder confidence, delivering value and exceeding the expectation of its shareholders, employees, stakeholders and the wider community. We continue to utilize the several Board Committees to provide thought leadership and robustly monitor the financial policies, business strategies, internal controls and risk management policies. The Board is committed to ensuring transparency and accountability in the operations of the business and keeping abreast of the disruptive trends wrought by technology with its impact on profitability and safe production practices.

The Board of Directors is made up of experienced professionals with diverse skills sets and knowledge acquired from various professional backgrounds. The combination of almost two hundred years of aggregate experience they bring to the Board ensures that decisions of the Board and Board Committees are grounded objectively and that all such decisions protect the interests of all stakeholders and the long-term success of the Company, both financially and socially.

All members of the CFF team are expected to faithfully adhere to the Company’s policies and procedures and execute their daily activities at the highest standards of ethical conduct, thereby ensuring compliance with the rules of the Jamaica Stock Exchange and the laws and regulations of Jamaica.

Two (2) technical assessments were also commissioned and executed by a technical services provider. The members of this Committee are:

• Howard Mitchell
• Anand James
• Carlton Samuels

Corporate Social Responsibility

We all can agree that 2020 was unlike any other year that the world has ever seen since the pandemic of 1918. To say that the world was caught unaware and therefore not prepared is putting it mildly. Many companies worldwide were closed, some temporary and the new mode of operations via the digital space has been the norm. For us in Jamaica, it was no different. In fact, we continue to struggle with the lack of business activities as the government tries to balance the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic with the economic realities whilst trying to balance with people’s livelihood. This has resulted in many persons losing jobs and many small businesses closing their doors. Small business has been an important customer base of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances.

Despite this new norm, we at Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances (CFF) remain committed to ensuring that we continue to be good corporate citizens in taking care of the environment, the less fortunate in the communities adjacent to our operations, education, as well as our children. We remained resolute in ensuring that our Directors, Management and Staff operate within strong and sound business ethics, while we serve the business community. Selfless service is one of the tenets on which our entire operation is built.

With great uncertainties, we collectively braced for any eventualities that would arise while keeping focused on continuous improvement and development. At the start of this pandemic there was a shortage of hand sanitizer on the local market; without hesitation the Team at Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances was quick on developing food safe liquid sanitizers. We ensured that it met the full requirements of the Bureau of Standards and is listed for trade on the National Compliance Regulatory Authority’s (NCRA) website.

Being relevant and involved, community building is a big part of the Company’s corporate strategy, therefore the Company donated hand sanitizers of substantial value to the Jamaica Constabulary Force and various other communities within and outside the Penwood area. We also supplied the End Time Basic School and National Baptist Schools with sanitizers while they were open.

In addition to providing hand sanitizers, we prepared care packages, and these were given to over fifty (50) students and teachers within the communities. These care packages contain food items and toiletries, and they were well received by students, teachers, and parents. We remain humbled by the reach of our corporate contributions; each one can reach one.

The development of our staff is of paramount importance and we continue to provide various exposure opportunities in the form of training, scholarships and bursaries, opportunities to not only members of staff but as well as an internship program to individuals who are in need. We believe that when we assist an individual to equip themselves through learning we are providing them with an opportunity for nation building and also procuring a brighter future for our youths.

We at Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited recognize that our people are our greatest asset therefore we freely give. A journey of a thousand steps begins with one and we remain focused on helping others when we can, while we can.

We remained resolute in ensuring that our Directors, Management and Staff operate within strong and sound business ethics, while we serve the business community. Selfless service is one of the tenets on which our entire operation is built.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
Caribbean Flavours and Fragrance Limited

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited (“the Company”) set out on pages 1 to 42, which comprise the statement of financial position at 31 December 2020, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2020, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants' (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

Other matter
The financial statements of Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited for the year ended 31 December 2019, were audited by another firm of auditors whom expressed an unmodified opinion on those financial statements on 27 February 2020.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements

Our Audit Approach

Audit scope
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. Key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with the Audit Committee members (those charged with Governance) but are not intended to represent all matters that were discussed with them. These matters are addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. During the audit, we encountered no key audit matter for disclosure.

Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Responsibilities of Management and those charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with the governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that presents a true and fair view.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the director, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matter communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstance, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

As required by the Jamaican Companies Act, we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaica Companies Act, in the manner required.

Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements
31 December 2020

1. Identification and Principal Activities

Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited ("the Company") was incorporated under the Companies Act of Jamaica and domiciled in Jamaica. The Company is listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

The company’s registered office is located at 226 Spanish Town Road, Kingston 11.

Its principal activity is the manufacture and distribution of flavours, mainly for the beverage, baking and confectionery industries. The Company also manufactures fragrances primarily for household and general cleaning and sanitation purposes.

These financial statements are presented in Jamaican dollars, which is the functional currency.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied for all the years presented. Where necessary, prior year comparatives have been restated and reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

(a) Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and their interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and have been prepared under the historical cost convention. They are also prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

The financial statements comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period and the total comprehensive income during the reporting period. The company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any adjustments that may be necessary would be reflected in the year in which actual results are known. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment in complexity or areas where assumptions or estimates are significant to the financial statements are discussed in Note 4.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)

Standards and amendments to published standards effective in the current year that are relevant to the company’s operations

The following standard have been adopted by the company for the first time which have been issued and are effective for mandatory adoption for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2020 and have a material impact on the company:

Definition of a Business – Amendments to IFRS 3 (effective for Business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is amended to focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating investment income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. The amendments will likely result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions.

Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8) The amendments clarify the definition of ‘material’ and align the definition used in the Conceptual Framework and the standards. The amendment further clarifies that the reference to obscuring information addresses situations in which the effect is similar to omitting or misstating that information, and that an entity assesses material in the context of the financial statements as a whole. The standard also states that the meaning of ‘primary users of general-purpose financial statements’ to whom those financial statements are directed, by defining them as ‘existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors’ that must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)

Standards and amendments to published standards effective in the current year that are relevant to the Company’s operations (continued)

Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The IASB has issued a revised Conceptual Framework which will be used in standard-setting decisions with immediate effect. These new standards include increasing the prominence of stewardship in the objective of financial reporting. It also includes changes in reinstating prudence as a component of neutrality. Further key changes include defining a reporting entity, which may be a legal entity, or a portion of an entity and revising the definitions of an asset and a liability as well as removing the probability threshold for recognition and adding guidance on de-recognition

The standard further includes changes to adding guidance on different measurement basis and stating that profit of loss is the primary performance indicator and that, in principle, income and expenses in other comprehensive income should be recycled where this enhances the relevance or faithful representation of the financial statements

The standard clarifies that no changes will be made to any of the current accounting standards. However, entities that rely on the Framework in determining their accounting policies for transactions, events or conditions that are not otherwise dealt with under the accounting standards will need to apply the revised Framework from 1 January 2020.

Amendments to IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ on ‘plan amendment, curtailment or settlement’ (effective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2020). These amendments require an entity to: use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement; and recognise in profit or loss as part of past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, any reduction in a surplus, even if that surplus was not previously recognized because of the impact of the asset ceiling. Entities should also separately recognise any changes in the asset ceiling through other comprehensive income.

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)

Standards and amendments to published standards effective in the current year that are relevant to the company’s operations (continued)

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) Reporting (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The changes in Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)
• modify specific hedge accounting requirements so that entities would apply those hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and cash flows from the hedging instrument are based will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform;
• are mandatory for all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform;
• are not intended to provide relief from any other consequences arising from interest rate benchmark reform (if a hedging relationship no longer meets the requirements for hedge accounting for reasons other than those specified by the amendments, discontinuation of hedge accounting is required); and
• require specific disclosures about the extent to which the entities' hedging relationships are affected by the amendments.

The amendments did not result in any material effect on the company’s financial statements.

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)

Standards and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the company

Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). In March 2018, the IASB issued the 2018 Conceptual Framework and most references to the Framework included in IFRSs were updated to the 2018 Framework at that time. However, paragraph 11 of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, which continued to refer to the 1989 Framework, was not updated as this could have caused conflicts for entities applying IFRS 3. IASB identified three possible amendments to IFRS 3 that would update IFRS 3 without significantly changing its requirements. The changes in Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3):

• update IFRS 3 so that it refers to the 2018 Conceptual Framework instead of the 1989 Framework;

• add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptual Framework) to identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination; and

• add to IFRS 3 an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets acquired in a business combination.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)

Standards and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the company (continued)

The amendments in Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Amendments to IAS 1 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023) affect only the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position — not the amount or timing of recognition of any asset, liability income or expenses, or the information that entities disclose about those items. They:

• clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the "right" to defer settlement by at least twelve months and make explicit that only rights in place "at the end of the reporting period" should affect the classification of a liability;
• clarify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability; and
• make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.

Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022) amends the standard to prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss.

Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37), (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022) specifies that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts (an example would be the allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract.

Standards and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the company (continued)

Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. The IASB issued its Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 cycle amending a number of standards:

• IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ - Subsidiary as a first-time adopter. The amendment permits a subsidiary that applies paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by its parent, based on the parent’s date of transition to IFRSs.
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ - Fees in the ‘10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial liabilities. The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the ‘10 per cent’ test in paragraph B3.3.6 of IFRS 9 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. An entity includes only fees paid or received between the entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other’s behalf.
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ - Lease incentives. The amendment to Illustrative Example 13 accompanying IFRS 16 removes from the example the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how lease incentives are illustrated in that example.
• IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ - Taxation in fair value measurements. The amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 for entities to exclude taxation cash flows when measuring the fair value of a biological asset using a present value technique. This will ensure consistency with the requirements in IFRS 13.

Standards and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the company (continued)

Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions – Amendments to IFRS 16 (effective for Business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 June 2020). The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published 'Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)' amending the standard to provide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification.

The changes in Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16) amend IFRS 16 to:

• provide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification;
• require lessees that apply the exemption to account for COVID-19-related rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications;
• require lessees that apply the exemption to disclose that fact; and
• require lessees to apply the exemption retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8, but not require them to restate prior period figures.

There are no other standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company.

(b) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis at rates to write off the carrying value of the assets over their expected useful lives. The rates used to write off the cost of assets are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold property</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, office equipment</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Office computer and equipment</td>
    <td>33\(^{1/3}\)%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Motor vehicle</td>
    <td>25%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Leasehold improvements are classified as property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the statement of comprehensive income.

Repairs and maintenances are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred

(c) Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities

All leases are accounted for by recognising a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for:
(i) Leases of low value assets; and
(ii) Leases with a duration of 12 months or less.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor over the lease term, with the discount rate determined by reference to the rate inherent in the lease unless (as is typically the case) this is not readily determinable, in which case the company’ incremental borrowing rate on commencement of the lease is used. Variable lease payments are only included in the measurement of the lease liability if they depend on an index or rate. In such cases, the initial measurement of the lease liability assumes the variable element will remain unchanged throughout the lease term. Other variable lease payments are expensed in the period to which they relate.

*End of Page 53*

### Page 54

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

(c) Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities (continued)

On initial recognition, the carrying value of the lease liability also includes:
(i) amounts expected to be payable under any residual value guarantee;
(ii) the exercise price of any purchase option granted in favour of the company if it is reasonably certain to assess that option;
(iii) any penalties payable for terminating the lease, if the term of the lease has been estimated on the basis of termination option being exercised.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the company:
(i) since it does not have recent third-party financing, uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases, and
(ii) makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, currency and security.

Right of use assets are initially measured at the amount of the lease liability, reduced for any lease incentives received, and increased for:

(i) lease payments made at or before commencement of the lease;
(ii) initial direct costs incurred; and
(iii) the amount of any provision recognised where the company is contractually required to dismantle, remove or restore the leased asset (typically leasehold dilapidations).

Subsequent to initial measurement lease liabilities increase as a result of interest charged at a constant rate on the balance outstanding and are reduced for lease payments made. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease or over the remaining economic life of the asset if, rarely, this is judged to be shorter than the lease term.

Payments associated with short-term leases and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are assets valued as US$5,000 or less when new. The company has no short-term leases or leases for low valued assets at this time.

(c) Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities (continued)

Extension and termination options
Extension and termination options are included for the property leased by the company. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the asset used in the company’ operations. The extension option is exercisable by the lessee provided that thirty (30) days written notice is given prior to the expiration of the initial term. Either party may terminate the lease on the provision that not less than twelve (12) months’ notice in writing is given to the other party.

When the company renegotiates the contractual terms of a lease with the lessor, the accounting depends on the nature of the modification:
▪ If the renegotiation results in one or more additional assets being leased for an amount commensurate with the standalone price for the additional rights-of-use obtained, the modification is accounted for as a separate lease in accordance with the above policy.
▪ In all other cases where the renegotiated increases the scope of the lease (whether that is an extension to the lease term, or one or more additional assets being leased), the lease liability is re-measured using the discount rate.
▪ Applicable on the modification date, with the right-of-use asset being adjusted by the same amount.
▪ If the renegotiation results in a decrease in the scope of the lease, both the carrying amount of the lease liability and right-of-use asset are reduced by the same proportion to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease with any difference recognised in profit or loss. The lease liability is then further adjusted to ensure its carrying amount reflects the amount of the renegotiated payments over the renegotiated term, with the modified lease payments discounted at the rate applicable on the modification date. The right-of-use asset is adjusted by the same amount.

The carrying value of lease liabilities is similarly revised when the variable element of future lease payments dependent on a rate or index is revised. In both cases an equivalent adjustment is made to the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, with the revised carrying amount being amortised over the remaining (revised) lease term.

For contracts that both convey a right to the company to use an identified asset and require services to be provided to the company by the lessor, the company has elected to account for the entire contract as a lease, i.e. it does not allocate any amount of the contractual payments to, and account separately for, any services provided by the supplier as part of the contract.

(d) Inventories
Estimation – Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realized value. The estimation of net realized value is based on the most reliable evidence available, at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realize.

Additionally, estimation is required for inventory provision due to shrinkage, slow-moving and obsolescence. It is possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are different from those assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.

(e) Financial assets

The company classifies its financial assets into the category amortized cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.

Receivables, cash and equivalents and investments

The company’s financial assets measured at amortized cost comprise trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and investments in the statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less.

These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

Impairment provisions for trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses. During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within the statement of profit or loss. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.

(f) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

(g) Dividends
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognized in shareholder’s equity in the period in which they become legally payable. Interim dividends are due when declared and approved by the directors while shareholders approve final dividends at the Annual General Meeting. Dividends for the year that are declared after the reporting date are disclosed in the subsequent events note.

(h) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Preference shares, which are mandatorily redeemable on a specific date, are classified as liabilities. The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense.

Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

(i) Payables
Payables, including provisions, are stated at their nominal value. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(j) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be determined.

(k) Income taxes
Where applicable, taxation expense in the statement of comprehensive income comprises current and deferred tax charges.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be paid or recovered on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax bases. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Currently enacted tax rates are used in the determination of deferred income tax.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

(l) Financial instruments
Financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position include cash and bank balances, receivables, balances with related parties, payables, balances with directors, lease liabilities and borrowings.

The fair values of financial instruments and the associated risks are discussed in Note 3a.

(m) Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Jamaican dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the statement of financial position, that is, in the case of each currency, the Bank of Jamaica weighted average buying and selling rates at that date. Gains and losses arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income.

(n) Revenue recognition

Sale of goods
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Revenue is shown net of returns, discounts and GCT. The company’s revenue is generally derived from selling goods with revenue recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has been delivered to the customer and acceptance by them of the payment invoice. Once the physical delivery of the products to the agreed location and customer has occurred, and the Company is no longer liable for any of the goods, the transaction is considered complete.

Interest income
Interest income and expense are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price.

Other operating income
Other operating income, where applicable, includes gains on disposal of assets recognized when the transaction is complete, rental of investment property recognized when earned, and miscellaneous inflows recognized when received and monies lodged to the Company’s bank account.

(o) Comparative information
Where necessary comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with changes in presentation.

(p) Related party transactions

A party is related to the company, if:

(i) directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the party, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the company (this includes parents, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries); has an interest in the company that gives it significant influence over the company; or has joint control over the company;

(ii) the party is an associate of the company;

(iii) the party is a joint venture in which the company is a venturer;

(iv) the party is a member of the key management personnel of the company or its parent;

(v) the party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (i) or (iv);

(vi) the party is the company that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to in (iv) or (v); or

(vii) the party is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of the company, or of any company that is a related party of the company.

A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged. The company has a related party relationship with its directors and key management personnel, representing certain senior officers of the company.

3. Financial Risk Management

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, related party balances, director’s account, lease liabilities and borrowings.

a) Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument. The company’s equities are the only financial instrument that is carried at fair value, also where fair value of financial instruments approximates carrying value, no fair value computation is done.

The carrying values reflected in the financial statements for cash and cash equivalent, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.

The fair value of long-term loans is assumed to approximate carrying value as the loans bear interest at market rates and all other conditions are at market terms.

Quoted equities fair values are based on the bid prices published by the Jamaica Stock Exchange Determination of fair value and fair values hierarchy:

IFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 -Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments on exchanges.

Level 2 -Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This includes financial assets with fair values based on broker quotes.

Level 3-Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.

The company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.

b) Credit risk:
The company takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that its customers, clients or counterparties will cause a financial loss for the company by failing to discharge their contractual obligations. Credit risk is the most important risk for the company’s business; management therefore carefully manages its exposure to credit risk. Credit exposures arise principally from the company’s receivables from customers. The company structures the level of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to a single counterparty or groups of related counterparties and to geographical and industry segments.

Credit review process
Management performs ongoing analysis of the ability of customers and other counterparties to meet their obligations.

Impairment of financial assets
The company has one type of financial asset that is subject to the expected credit loss model which is trade receivables for sales of inventory.

While investment and cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

Trade receivables
The company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.

To measure expected credit losses on a collective basis, trade receivables is grouped based on similar credit risk and ageing.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 31 December 2020, and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

b) Credit risk (continued)

Trade receivables

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the company, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 90 days past due.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

As at 31 December 2020, there were no lifetime expected credit losses in respect of the five (5) major customers that comprise 58% (2019 – 73%) of the trade receivables balance.

Other financial assets at amortised cost
Other financial assets at amortised cost include other receivables and balances due from related parties.

While the other financial assets at amortised cost are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the company, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 90 days past due.

At the Statement of Financial Position date, except for cash and cash equivalents, there were no other significant concentration of credit risk and the exposure to credit risk of these financial assets were considered immaterial.

c) Liquidity risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.

Liquidity risk management process
The company’s liquidity management process includes:

(i) Monitoring future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis;
(ii) Maintaining marketable and diverse assets that can easily be liquidated as protection against any unforeseen interruption to cash flow;
(iii) Maintaining a committed line of credit;
(iv) Optimizing cash returns on investment.

Undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the company’s financial liabilities at year end on contractual undiscounted payments was as follows:

d) Market risk

The company takes on exposure to market risks, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risks mainly arise from changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see 3d (i), interest rates (see 3d (ii)). The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. There has been no significant change in exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

(i) Currency risk

The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure primarily to the US dollar and Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily from transactions for purchases, sales and investments. The Statement of Financial Position for the Company as at 31 December 2020 includes net foreign assets of US$927,277 and €17,613 (2019: US$857,453 and €17,022) in respect of such transactions.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies held by the company before tax, with all other variables held constant.

(ii) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The company minimises interest rate risk by investing mainly in fixed rate instruments and contracting liabilities at fixed rates, where possible. The company’s interest rate risk arises mainly from bank loans.

At the reporting date, the interest profile of the company’s interest-bearing financial Instruments were:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2020<br>$’000</th>
    <th>2019<br>$’000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Financial assets</td>
    <td>147,780</td>
    <td>125,744</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Fair value sensitivity analysis for financial instruments:

The company accounts for some interest bearing financial instrument at fair value, therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would affect the carrying value of the company’s financial instruments.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for financial instruments:

A change in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

e) Capital management:

The policy of the company’s Board of Directors is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business and ensure it continues as a going concern.

The company considers its capital to be its total equity inclusive of unappropriated profits and capital reserves. The company’s financial objective is to generate a targeted operating surplus, in order to strengthen and provide for the future continuity of the company as a going concern in order to provide returns for its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Directors regularly review the financial position of the company at meetings and monitor the return on capital and the level of dividends to the ordinary shareholders. They seek to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

The company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Debt is the total of long-term loans and bank overdraft less related party loans, if any. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the company’s statement of financial position plus debt. The gearing ratios at the year-end based on these calculations were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2020<br>$'000</th>
    <th>2019<br>$'000</th>

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies

The company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

(i) Impairment of financial assets
The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the company’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of the key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in the Credit risk note.

(ii) Income taxes
Estimates and judgements are required in determining the provision for income taxes. The tax liability or asset arising from certain transactions or events may be uncertain during the ordinary course of business. In cases of such uncertainty, the company recognises liabilities for possible additional taxes based on its judgement. Where, on the basis of subsequent determination, the final tax outcome in relation to such matters is different from the amount that was initially recognised, the difference will impact the current and deferred income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

(iii) Depreciable assets
Estimates of the useful life and the residual value of property, plant and equipment are required in order to apply an adequate rate of transferring the economic benefits embodied in these assets in the relevant periods. The company applies a variety of methods in an effort to arrive at these estimates from which actual results may vary. Actual variations in estimated useful lives and residual values are reflected in profit or loss through impairment or adjusted depreciation provisions.

(iv) Fair value of financial assets
The management uses its judgment in selecting appropriate valuation techniques to determine fair values of financial assets adopting valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners supported by appropriate assumptions (note 3(a)).

19. Taxation (continued)

The Company’s 100% remission of income taxes expired 2 October 2018, and as a consequence the Company’s taxable profits will be subject to 50% tax remission until 2 October 2023.

The Company will continue to benefit from the tax remission provided the following conditions are met:

• the Company remains listed for at least 15 years and is not suspended from the JSE for any breaches of its rules
• the Subscribed Participating Voting Share Capital of the Company does not exceed J$500 million
• the Company has at least 50 Participating Voting Shareholders.

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will have the full benefit of the tax remissions.

20. Earnings per share

Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year after taxation by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The number of ordinary shares outstanding at the year were:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2020<br>$'000</th>

    <td>Earnings per share</td>
    <td>0.09</td>

23. Coronavirus (Covid-19)

The novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organisation. The pandemic and the measures to control its human impact have resulted in the disruption of international and local economic activities, commerce, business operations and assets prices. The Government implemented a number of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus, including nightly curfews, home quarantine for citizens of a specific age and restrictions on the number of persons in public gathering. These restrictions have had adverse economic effects on the operations of many stakeholders.

Caribbean Flavours and Fragrances Limited continue to source raw materials from many countries that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19 and despite the challenges faced and the restrictions imposed, our operations have not been significantly impacted. This is due to the proactivity of Management in introducing various measures during the early stage of the pandemic in order to minimize or mitigate any impending impact of the virus. Additionally, the Company adopted the recommended protocols and implemented new procedures geared at minimizing exposures and contact spreading. During the year, none of our employees was infected.

The Company was able to quickly respond by introducing its own Hand Sanitizer to the market, this had the double effect of protecting individuals and improving our financial results as we saw an increase in our total revenues by 28% when compared to 2019. Based on management assessment, the significance of the impact on our operation was mitigated, this is evidenced by the increase in the demand for our products during the reporting year.

Management confirms the Company as a going concern as it is not expected to be significantly impacted in a negative way by the Covid-19 pandemic.
