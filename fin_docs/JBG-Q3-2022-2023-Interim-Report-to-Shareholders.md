INTERIM REPORT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

The Directors of Jamaica Broilers Group Limited now release the unaudited financial results for the quarter ended January 28, 2023 which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The Group's operations produced a net profit of $1.5 billion for the quarter ended 28 January 2023, a 27% increase over the $1.2 billion achieved in the corresponding period in the prior year. Group revenues for the quarter amounted to $22.7 billion, a 20% increase above the $18.9 billion achieved in the corresponding period in the prior year, while gross profit for the quarter was $5.5 billion.

The Jamaica Operations reported a segment result of $5.5 billion, which was $2.6 billion or 88% above the last year's segment results. Total revenue for our Jamaica Operations showed an increase of 36% over the prior year's nine-month period. This increase was primarily driven by increased production and sale of poultry, as well as increased sale of baby chicks to our small farmers. The reopening of Jamaica's economy, particularly the tourism industry, has contributed to the increased demand driving sales.

The President noted that the strong results have been driven by a recovery in our poultry volumes to pre-COVID levels, as well as a comprehensive restructuring exercise that was undertaken. As the results of those efforts continue to bear fruit, paired with a strong economy, our expectations for the Jamaican market continue to be positive.

Our US Operations reported a segment result of $2.8 billion, which was $958 million or 53% above last year's performance when normalised for one-off other income of $584 million reported in last year's results. Total revenue for the US Operations showed an increase of 16% over the prior year's nine-month period. This increase was primarily driven by the increased production and sales in The Best Dressed Chicken line of products.

The Staff, Management and the Board of Directors of Jamaica Broilers Group Limited continue to trust in the Lord's guidance for our company and are grateful for His Blessings and Provision.
