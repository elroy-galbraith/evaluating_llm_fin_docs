Report to the Shareholders

The board of directors is pleased to present the unaudited results of JFP Limited for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022.

Profit and Loss

Year to date revenue was reported at 328.7M, an increase of 119M or 57% over the prior year comparative period. Total sales for the quarter was 115.1M which represents a 24% increase over the quarter ended September 2021. The increase in year to date and quarterly comparatives was due to completion of orders previously secured as well as JFP’s capability to streamline operational processes in meeting customers deadlines.

The quarterly cost of sales increased by 26%. However, the year-to-date cost of sales was normalized bringing a minimal decline of 1%. Gross profit for the nine-month period ended September 2022 increased by 129% over the corresponding prior year period. Gross Profit margin also saw an improvement moving from 44% to 65%.

There was a decline in other income within the quarter, resulting in a year-to-date reduction of 99% moving from 20M to 0.13M. This was due to losses from the investment currently held at GK Capital which were as a result of the devaluation of the equity investments held, as well as the sale of a portion of the equity investments to fund cash flow. In the previous financial year there was a sale of motor vehicle for 6.7M. Further details on the use of these funds are provided in the balance sheet analysis below. The acquisition of the 2022 portion of this GK investment was done subsequent to the IPO.

Administrative expenses for the nine-month period was 142.9M reflecting an increase of 46M or 48% over the prior year’s reporting period. This increase was due primarily to increased staff costs as we continue to build our capacity to support continued growth in our operations. Our overtime expenses increased significantly within the quarter in order to respond to both our challenge of acquiring additional skilled labourers as well as our need to complete our projects on time. We have also continued with the quarterly incentives to our staff in the form of a productivity grant award.

Selling and distribution expenses increased by 244% moving from 4.5M to 14.7M over the comparative nine-month period. This was due primarily to increase in promotional and business development expenses which have increased as we continue to grow and expand our brand regionally and internationally. JFP has invested in its marketing strategy and completed three international trade shows this year costing approximately 6M.

There was an improvement in the year-to-date bottom line which saw JFP moving from a profit of 3.5M to a profit of 43.1M. This was driven primarily by an increase in sales and by extension, gross profit.

Balance Sheet

As acknowledged in the previous quarterly report property, plant and equipment value decreased in year-to-date value, due to the sale of the factory building as part of the IPO process

The long-term investment portfolio held at GK Capital saw an increase of 31% over the corresponding nine-month period last year. However, this quarter saw a decline over the previous quarter due to the withdrawal of portions of the investment which were re-allocated for cashflow purposes.

Receivables increased by 60% moving from 95.1M to 152.6M. This was due to a number of projects being completed for which we are still awaiting payment. Cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of withdrawal of portions of the GK Capital investment for deposit in the bank account for cash flow purposes as referenced above. This was done to temporarily support working capital until receivables are collected. The year-to-date balances for the Director’s current account continue to decline as a result of repayment of advances by Directors.

The inventory increased by 304% moving from $29M to $117.2M. Management has taken a conscious decision to guard against shortages in inventory and also to maximize customer service and efficiency of logistics as the supply chain is unstable and can impact our ability to meet our customers timelines. As a result, we continue to carry inventory for the substantial number of jobs in production which has surpassed our budgeted annual sales. The inventory held is expected to decline in the next quarter as the majority of those orders will be completed by year end.

Our total current liabilities increased by 76%. This was largely due to the outstanding balances on the lease and increase in our general payables related to importation of supplies of raw materials to complete the jobs in progress as at 30 September 2022. A substantial portion of this lease liability is expected to be paid by year end from receivables to be settled.

The retained earnings decreased from 206.8M to 99.2 M or 52%, due to dividends being declared at the end of December 2021. Non-current liabilities increased due to the lease agreement for the factory.

In closing, the Board of Directors wish to express gratitude to the employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and all other stakeholders for the continued support and ongoing contribution to the growth of the company.

JFP Limited, (the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The registered office of the company and principal place of business is located at 155 Spanish Town Road, Kingston, Jamaica. Under Section 17 of the Companies Act, the Company changed its name to JFP Limited, effective 3rd December 2021.

The Company’s principal activities are the manufacturing and distribution of custom-built commercial furnishings and the financial statements are stated in Jamaica dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.

The Company’s shares were listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) on March 14, 2022. As a consequence of listing, the Company’s profit will be subjected to 100% tax remission for the first five (5) five years and thereafter, will be subjected to 50% tax remission for the next 5 years as long as the Company complies with certain Junior Market regulations.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

This condensed consolidated interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, Interim financial reporting.

The condensed interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these un-audited financial statements are consistent with those used in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

(i) Property, plant and equipment:

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (CONTINUED)
(ii) Depreciation:
Depreciation is recognized on profit or loss on the straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

(iii) Borrowings:
Borrowings are recognized initially as the proceeds received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost using the effective interest method with any difference between proceeds net of transactions costs and the redemption value recognized in income along with regular interest charges over the period of the borrowings.

(iv) Impairment:
Impairment provisions for trade receivables are recognized based on the simplified approach allowable under IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the expected credit losses (ECL).

5. EARNINGS PER STOCK UNIT
The earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the profit for the period by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the nine (9) month period of 1,083,076,923.08 (2021 – 1,000).

6. SHARE CAPITAL
Authorized:
10,000,000,000 shares (2021 – 1,000 shares)
