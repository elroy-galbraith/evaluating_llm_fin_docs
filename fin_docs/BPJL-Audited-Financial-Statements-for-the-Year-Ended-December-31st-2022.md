INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the members of Berger Paints Jamaica Limited

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Berger Paints Jamaica Limited (the “company”), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, the statements of income, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2022, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ (“IESBA”) International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, informing our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

    <td>The company's post-retirement benefit provisions relate to a defined benefit pension scheme amounting to an asset of $81.11 million and a retiree medical post-retirement benefit scheme amounting to a liability of $94.53 million.

These provisions require a significant level of judgement and technical expertise in their determination. The key assumptions used include the discount rate, inflation rate, mortality and future salary increases which involve judgement. Changes to the assumptions could have a significant impact to the post-employment benefits recognized.

Management uses external actuaries to assist in determining these key assumptions and in valuing the assets and liabilities within the schemes.</td>
    <td>As part of our audit, we have assessed whether the key actuarial assumptions adopted by management are reasonable and consistently applied. The discount and inflation rates were agreed to those issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Jamaica. In addition, we tested the valuation of relevant scheme assets. We also performed substantive audit procedures on the underlying participants’ data that was provided to the actuary.

We placed reliance on the actuary’s report and therefore assessed the actuary’s qualifications (i.e., professional certification, membership in an appropriate professional body), experience and reputation in the field. We also assessed the actuary’s objectivity and evaluated the work performed (including reviewing the assumptions and inputs used in the report) in accordance with ISA 620 Using the Work of an Expert.

We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements.</td>

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

Other information included in the Annual Report

Other information consists of the information included in the company’s annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Management is responsible for the other information. The company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities of Management and the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

To the members of Berger Paints Jamaica Limited (Continued)

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that presents a true and fair view.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on additional requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit. In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act, in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Kayann Sudlow.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

1. IDENTIFICATION

The main activity of the company, which is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica, is the manufacture and distribution of industrial and decorative paints and paint-related processed materials.

The company, which is listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange, is a 54.12% subsidiary of Ansa Coatings International Limited. The ultimate holding company is Ansa McAL Limited, which is incorporated in Trinidad. The registered office of the company is 256 Spanish Town Road, Kingston 11.

These financial statements are expressed in Jamaican dollars.

The Board of Directors has the power to amend these financial statements after issue, if required.

2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

2.1 Standards and interpretations affecting amounts reported and or disclosed in the current period (and/or prior period)

There were no standards and interpretations that were applied in the year that affected the presentation and disclosures in these financial statements.

2.2 Standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards adopted with no effect on the financial statements

The following additional new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements. Their adoption has not had any impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions or arrangements.

Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases - Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021 (effective April 1, 2021)

On May 28, 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') amended IFRS 16 Leases to provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification to rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In March 2021, the IASB amended the conditions of the practical expedient. Following the amendment, the practical expedient now applies to rent concessions for which any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2022, provided the other conditions for applying the practical expedient are met.

As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16 if the change were not a lease modification.

2.2 Standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards adopted with no effect on the financial statements (continued)

Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases - Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021 (effective April 1, 2021) (continued)

The practical expedient applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic and only if all the following conditions are met:

• The change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change.

• Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2022.

• There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.

Lessees will apply the practical expedient retrospectively, recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendment as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the amendment is first applied.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2021, however earlier application is permitted. These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the company.

Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use
In May 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use, which prohibits entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment. These amendments had no impact on the company’s financial statements.

Reference to Conceptual Framework- Amendments to IFRS 3
In May 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Reference to the Conceptual Framework. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to a previous version of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework (the 1989 Framework) with a reference to the current version issued in March 2018 (the Conceptual Framework) without significantly changing its requirements.

The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately.

2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)

2.2 Standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards adopted with no effect on the financial statements (continued)

Reference to Conceptual Framework- Amendments to IFRS 3 (continued)
The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. At the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date.

The amendments must be applied prospectively. Earlier application is permitted if, at the same time or earlier, an entity also applies all of the amendments contained in the Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (March 2018).

The amendments are intended to update a reference to the Conceptual Framework without significantly changing requirements of IFRS 3. The amendments will promote consistency in financial reporting and avoid potential confusion from having more than one version of the conceptual Framework in use. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. These amendments did not have an impact on the financial statements.

Annual Improvements 2018 - 2020 Cycle (issued in May 2020)
These improvements include:
• IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards – Subsidiary as a first-time adopter- effective January 1, 2022
• IFRS 9 Financial instruments – Fees in the 10 “per cent” test for derecognition of financial liabilities - effective January 1, 2022
• IAS 41 Agriculture -Taxation in fair value measurements– effective January 1, 2022

These improvements did not have an impact on the financial statements

2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)

2.3 Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not yet been early adopted by the company (continued)

New and Revised Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet effective that are relevant

The Board of Directors and management have assessed the impact of all the new and revised Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective and have concluded that the following is relevant to the operations of the company and are likely to impact amounts reported in the company’s future financial statements:

Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current
In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:

• What is meant by a right to defer settlement
• That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period
• That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right
• That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and must be applied retrospectively. The directors and management have not yet assessed the impact of the application of this amendment on the company’s financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates, and errors: Definition of accounting estimates
In February 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 8, which introduces a new definition of accounting estimates. The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors.

The amended standard clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. The previous definition of a change in accounting estimate specified that changes in accounting estimates may result from new information or new developments. Therefore, such changes are not corrections of errors. This aspect of the definition was retained by the Board.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The directors and management have not yet assessed the impact of the application of this amendment on the company’s financial statements.

2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)

2.3 Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not yet been early adopted by the company (continued)

Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice statement 2: Disclosure of accounting policies
In February 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, in which it provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures.

The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by:
• Replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies, and
• Adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The directors and management have not yet assessed the impact of the application of this amendment on the company’s financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction

In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 12, which narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

The amendments clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements or to the related asset component. Under the amendments, the initial recognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. It only applies if the recognition of a lease asset and lease liability give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences that are not equal.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and should be applied retrospectively. The directors and management have not yet assessed the impact of the application of this amendment on the company’s financial statements.

Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback- Amendments to IFRS 16
The amendment to IFRS 16 specifies the requirements that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains.

The amendment does not prescribe specific measurement requirements for lease liabilities arising from a leaseback. The initial measurement of the lease liability arising from a leaseback may result in a seller-lessee determining ‘lease payments’ that are different from the general definition of lease payments in Appendix A of IFRS 16. The seller-lessee will need to develop and apply an accounting policy that results in information that is relevant and reliable in accordance with IAS 8.

Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback- Amendments to IFRS 16 (continued)
A seller-lessee applies the amendment to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted, and that fact must be disclosed. Management has not yet assessed the impact of these amendments on the financial statements.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

3.1 Statement of compliance

The company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the relevant requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act.

3.2 Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the company has performed a going concern assessment as of the reporting date. The company has concluded that there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on its ability to continue to operate as a going concern. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

3.3 Current versus non-current classification

The company presents assets and liabilities in statement of financial position based on current/non-current classification.

An asset is current when it is:

• Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle
• Held primarily for the purpose of trading
• Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
• Cash or cash equivalents unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

*End of Page 18*

---

### Page 19

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.3 Current versus non-current classification (continued)

A liability is current when:

• It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle
• It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

The company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

3.4 Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.5 Transactions with jointly controlled entities

Common control business combinations are scoped out of IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’. Where such transactions arise, management’s policy is to apply either the requirements of IFRS 3 or the “pooling of interests” method (“POI method”), the latter being an approach outside of the IFRS. The determination of which method is applied depends on:

a) Whether the common control business combination is deemed to have substance to the company. Substance exists where:

• There is a business purpose to the transaction;
• Outside parties, such as non-controlling interests are involved;
• The transaction was conducted at fair value; and
• The acquired company had business activities prior to the acquisition.

If the transaction is deemed to have no substance, then only the POI method can be applied.

b) The size and significance of the acquisition to the company.

c) The company’s reporting requirements.

The key differences between the POI method and the acquisition method under IFRS 3 are:

• The POI method does not permit fair valuation of assets or liabilities acquired. Instead, assets and liabilities are recognised at their carrying values.
• No new goodwill is generated under the POI method. Instead, any difference between the consideration paid and the carrying value of net assets acquired is recognised in equity.

The carrying values recognised are typically those within the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent company, ANSA McAL Limited, however there are situations where the carrying values recognised will be those within the stand-alone financial statements of the acquired entity. In determining which carrying values should be used, management considers:

• The timing of the transaction in comparison to when the acquired company was established within the company;
• The identity and nature of the users of the company’s financial statements; and
• Whether consistent accounting policies are used by the acquired company.

The company has a policy of combining the results of the acquired company from the acquisition date and not restating periods prior to the date of the combination. Further, equity balances are retained to allow for recycling of profits and equity that can occur as a result of future events.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.6 Property, plant, and equipment

All property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical or deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than land and properties under construction) less their residual values, over the estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Properties in the course of construction for production, supply, or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the company’s accounting policy. Such properties are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant, and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

3.7 Leases

The company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Company as a lessor
Leases in which the company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of income due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

Company as a lessee
The company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short term leases and leases of low value assets. The company recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

*End of Page 21*

### Page 22

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.7 Leases (continued)

Company as a lessee (continued)

Right-of-use assets
The company recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying assets is available for use). The right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of the initial lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made on or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

• Land and building	2 to 5 yrs.

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies at 3.8 “Impairment of non-financial assets”.

Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event of condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

Short term leases and leases of low-value assets
The company applies the short term lease recognition exemption to its short term leases (that is, those leases that have a lease term of 2 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.8 Impairment of non-financial assets

At the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

3.9 Employee benefits

3.9.1 Pension obligations
The company operates a defined benefit pension plan. The plan is funded by contributions from employees and employer. The employees contribute at the rate of 5% of pensionable salaries. The employees may make additional unmatched voluntary contributions up to the maximum permissible by the Income Tax Act. The employer contributes such funds as are necessary to meet the balance of the liabilities as determined by actuarial valuations subject to a maximum rate so that the total contributions (employee and employer) sum to 20% of pensionable salaries. The company’s rate of contribution of 5.5% is determined by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of external actuaries.

The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method with external actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.

Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.9 Employee benefits (continued)

3.9.1 Pension obligations (continued)

Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:

• The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
• The date that the company recognises restructuring-related costs

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit costs in the statement of income:

• Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements
• Net interest expense or income

3.9.2 Termination obligations
Termination benefits are payable whenever an employee’s employment is terminated involuntarily before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The company recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than twelve (12) months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.

3.9.3 Other post-retirement obligations
The company provides health benefits to qualifying employees upon retirement. The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using an accounting methodology similar to that used for the defined benefit pension plan as disclosed above.

3.10 Inventories

These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and cost of work-in-progress comprises direct materials and labour plus an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overhead expenses that have been incurred in bringing inventory to its present location and condition. Cost is arrived at based on the standard cost method (which approximates to the weighted average cost). Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

3.11 Financial instruments

Financial instruments include transactions that give rise to both financial assets and financial liabilities.

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the company’s statement of financial position when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities (except for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where such costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss), as appropriate, on initial recognition.

The fair values of financial instruments are discussed in Note 24. Listed below are the company’s financial assets and liabilities and the specific accounting policies relating to each:

3.11.1 Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the company’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the company has applied the practical expedient, the company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.

The company’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

3.11 Financial instruments (continued)

3.11.1 Financial assets (continued)

Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
• Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
• Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
• Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
This category is the most relevant to the company. The company measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

• The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

The company’s financial assets at amortised cost includes trade and other receivables including contract assets, due from related parties and cash and bank balances.

Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the company’s statement of financial position) when:

• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or
• The company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset

When the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.

3.11 Financial instruments (continued)

3.11.1 Financial assets (continued)

Derecognition (continued)
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the company has retained. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the company could be required to repay.

Impairment
The company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and contract assets, the company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 360 days past due. However, in certain cases, the company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

3.11.2 Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, lease liabilities, due to related parties and dividend payable.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

(a) Related party

A party is related to the company if:

(i) directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the party:
    - controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the company (this includes parent, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries);
    - has an interest in the entity that gives it significant influence over the company or;
    - has joint control over the company;
(ii) the party is an associate of the company;
(iii) the party is a joint venture in which the company is a venturer;
(iv) the party is a member of the key management personnel of the company or its parent;
(v) the party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (i) or (iv);
(vi) the party is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to in (iv) or (v); or
(vii) the party is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of the company, or of any entity that is a related party of the company.

Intercompany transactions are recorded at pre-determined company rates and are settled within 30 days. Interest is not charged on these balances as they are settled in a short period.

            (b) Dividends payable

                These are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting.

                Derecognition
                A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the statement of income.

3.12 Taxation

Income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the statement of income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

*End of Page 29*

### Page 30

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.12 Taxation (continued)

Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

The company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Current and deferred tax for the period
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Sales tax
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

- when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or part of the expense item as applicable.
- when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included.

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

3.13 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

3.14 Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the goods before transferring them to the customer.

The disclosures of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 4.

Sales of products to third parties
Revenue from the sale of products to third parties is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. The company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., warranties). In determining the transaction price for sales, the company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any).

(i) Variable consideration
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Certain customers are provided with a right of return and discount incentives based on volumes subject to the maintenance of their customer account on a current basis. The rights of return and discounts give rise to variable consideration.

• Rights of return
Certain contracts provide a customer with a right to return the goods within a specified period. The company uses the expected value method to estimate the goods that will not be returned because this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the company will be entitled. The requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For goods that are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the company recognises a refund liability. A right of return asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) is also recognised for the right to recover products from a customer.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.14 Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)

Sales of products to third parties (continued)

(i) Variable consideration (continued)

• Discount incentives
The company provides discount incentives under a partnership incentive plan (PIP) whereby discounts are applied at the point of invoicing to certain customers based on the achievement of volume targets and/or maintenance of their account on a current basis. The company uses historical performance to estimate the discount incentive tier the customer is likely to fall in subject to the attainment of the two criteria previously mentioned. The model is assessed on a quarterly basis.

(ii) Significant financing component
Where the company receives short-term advances from their customers, using the practical expedient in IFRS 15, the company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if they expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

Where the company receives long-term advances from customers, the transaction price for such contracts is discounted, using the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the company and their customers at contract inception, to take into consideration the significant financing component.

Contract balances

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.

Trade receivables
A receivable represents the company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section 3.11 Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement.

Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the company performs under the contract.

3.14 Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)

Assets and liabilities arising from rights of return

Right of return assets
Right of return asset represents the company’s right to recover the goods expected to be returned by customers. The asset is measured at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. The company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

Refund liabilities
A refund liability is the obligation to refund some or all of the consideration received (or receivable) from the customer and is measured at the amount the company ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. The company updates its estimates of refund liabilities (and the corresponding change in the transaction price) at the end of each reporting period. Refer to above accounting policy on variable consideration.

Cost to obtain a contract
The company pays sales commission to its employees for each contract that they obtain. The company has elected to apply the optional practical expedient for costs to obtain a contract which allows the company to immediately expense sales commissions (included under employee benefits and part of cost of sales) because the amortisation period of the asset that the company otherwise would have used is one year or less.

Interest revenue
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the amount of the income can be measured reliably.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.

3.15 Foreign currencies

The financial statements are presented in Jamaican dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates (its functional currency).

*End of Page 33*

---

### Page 34

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

3.15 Foreign currencies (continued)

In preparing the financial statements of the company, transactions in currencies other than the company’s functional currency, are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of a non-monetary item measured in fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair values gain is recognised in other comprehensive income or profit, or loss are also recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively). Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.

All other exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

3.16 Research and development expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

3.17 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

3.18 Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and for which discrete financial information is available.

Based on the information presented to and reviewed by the CODM, the operations of the company are considered as one operating segment.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies

a) Revenue from contracts with customers

Determining method to estimate variable consideration and assessing the constraint
Certain contracts for the sale of goods include a right of return and discount incentives that give rise to variable consideration. In estimating the variable consideration, the company is required to use either the expected value method or the most likely amount method based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.

The company determined that the expected value method is the appropriate method to use in estimating the variable consideration for the sale of various goods with rights of return, given the large number of customer contracts that have similar characteristics.

Before including any amount of variable consideration in the transaction price, the company considers whether the amount of variable consideration is constrained. The company determined that the estimates of variable consideration are not constrained based on its historical experience, business forecast and the current economic conditions. In addition, the uncertainty on the variable consideration will be resolved within a short time frame.

b) Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options – company as a lessee

The company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any period covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The company has lease contracts that include extensions and termination options. The company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate.

The company included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of property. The company typically exercises its option to renew for these leases. The periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

a) Post-employment benefits
As disclosed in Note 6, the company operates a defined benefit pension plan and provides post-retirement medical benefits. The amounts shown in the statement of financial position are an asset of approximately $81.11 million (2021: $212.13 million) in respect of the defined benefit pension plan and a liability of approximately $94.53 million (2021: $132.56 million) in respect of post-retirement medical liabilities. The post-employment benefits are subject to estimates in respect of periodic costs, which costs are dependent on future returns on assets, future discount rates, rates of salary increases and the inflation rate in respect of the pension plan, and rates of increases in medical costs for the post-retirement medical plan. External actuaries are contracted by the company in this regard.

The estimated return on pension assets assumption is determined by considering long-term historical returns, asset allocation and future estimates of long-term investment returns. The company estimates the appropriate discount rate annually, which rate is used to determine the present value of estimated cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension and post-retirement medical benefit obligation.

To determine the appropriate discount rate in the absence of high quality corporate bonds, the interest rates on government bonds that have maturities approximating the related pension liabilities were considered.

The expected increase in medical costs was determined by comparing the historical relationship of actual medical cost increases with the local rate of inflation. Current market conditions also impact the assumptions outlined above.

Note 6(i) details some sensitivity analyses in respect of these post-employment benefit plans.

b) Income taxes
Estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of estimates in respect of items deductible or not deductible for tax purposes is different from the amounts that were originally recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. A change of +/- 10% in the final tax outcome of these estimates would have the effect of approximately $nil million (2021: $3.64 million) increase/decrease in the current and deferred tax provisions.

c) Revenue from contracts with customers – Returns and incentive discounts

Estimating variable consideration for returns and incentive discounts
The company estimates variable considerations to be included in the transaction price for the sale of goods with rights of return.

### Page 37

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)

c) Revenue from contracts with customers – Returns and incentive discounts (continued)

Estimating variable consideration for returns and incentive discounts (continued)
The company developed a model for forecasting sales returns. The model used the historical return data of each product to derive expected return percentages. These percentages are applied to determine the expected value of the variable consideration. Any significant changes in experience as compared to historical return pattern will impact the expected return percentages estimated by the company.

The company’s expected incentive discount/volume rebates are analysed on a per customer basis for contracts that are subject to a single volume threshold among other factors. Determining whether a customer will be likely entitled to rebate will depend on the customer’s historical discount incentive/rebates entitlement and accumulated purchases to date among other factors.

The company applied a model for estimating expected incentive discounts for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The model uses the historical purchasing patterns and discounts entitlement of customers to determine the expected discount percentages and the expected value of the variable consideration. Any significant changes in experience as compared to historical purchasing patterns and discount entitlements of customers will impact the expected discounts percentages estimated by the company.

The company updates its assessment of expected returns and discounts periodically and the refund liabilities are adjusted accordingly. Estimates of expected returns and discounts are sensitive to changes in circumstances and the company’s past experience regarding returns and discount entitlements may not be representative of customers’ actual returns and discount entitlements in the future. As at December 31, 2022, the amount recognised as refund liabilities for the expected returns was maintained at $4.29 million.

d) Allowance for expected credit losses

The company uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for various ageing buckets and the related loss patterns. The provision matrix is initially based on the company’s historical observed default rates. The company will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., gross domestic product, inflation, and foreign exchange rates) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the construction sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The company’s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the company’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 11.

d) Allowance for expected credit losses (continued)

At year end, trade receivables totaled $693.57 million (2021: $583.35 million) for which an allowance for expected credit losses of $51.99 million (2021: $50.97 million) (Note 11) was recognised.

e) Provision for obsolescence of inventory

Estimates of provision for obsolescence of inventory are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realize. Estimates of provision for obsolescence also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held.

f) Leases - estimating the incremental borrowing rate

If the company cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, its uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the company ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease.

The company estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as stand-alone credit rating).

a) The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:

Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 6 years to 12½ years
Other fixed assets 4 years to 8 years

b) Freehold land and buildings were revalued in 1995 and the revaluation surplus of $49.579 million was credited to revaluation reserves. The revalued amounts of $27 million for land and $47.529 million for buildings have been designated the deemed cost of these assets, as permitted under the provisions of IFRS 1.

6. POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The company operates a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees and provides post-retirement medical benefits to its pensioners. The plans are exposed to interest rate risk, inflation, and changes in life expectancy for pensioners. Note 6(h) details the plan’s exposure in respect of various financial assets.

Plan information

Regulatory framework    The law requires each plan sponsor to be an ordinary annual contributor but does not stipulate a minimum funding rate or solvency level. In absence of guidance from the Financial Services Commission (Regulator), the working party of actuaries and auditors agreed on a minimum employer contributions rate of 0.25% of payroll per annum where plan rules do not specify a minimum.

Responsibilities    The trustees ensure benefits are funded, benefits are paid, and assets are invested to maximize return subject to acceptable investment risks while considering the liability profile. The board of trustees (including sponsor, employee, and pensioner representatives) have contracted a pension services provider to administer the plan’s activities. The plan is registered with the Financial Services Commission.

Asset-Liability Matching    Pensions are secured through the purchase of annuities. The remaining assets are invested in segregated pooled funds.

Defined benefit pension plan
This plan is funded by contributions from the employees and the company. The company contributes to the plan at rates determined by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of external actuaries (currently 5.5% (2021: 5.5%) of pensionable salaries) and the employees contribute at a rate of 5% of pensionable salaries (with the option of contributing an additional amount subject to a maximum rate so that the total contributions (employee and employer) sum to 20% of pensionable salaries). Pension benefits are determined on a prescribed benefits basis and are payable at a rate of 1½% of the employee’s average earnings over the three years prior to retirement multiplied by the employee’s number of years membership in the plan.

Retiree medical plan
The company bears the full cost of health care of employees after retirement.

Valuation
The most recent actuarial valuations for IFRS purposes of the two plans were carried out as at December 31, 2021, by Apex Consulting Limited (Consulting Actuaries), Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The obligations were measured using the projected unit credit method. The last actuarial valuation to determine the adequacy of funding done as at December 31, 2018, revealed that the plan was adequately funded at that date. The triennial valuation was still pending at the date of issuance of these financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

10. BALANCES/TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES (CONTINUED)

Sale of goods to related parties were made at the predetermined company rates. Purchases are made at market prices discounted to reflect the quantity of goods purchased and the relationships between the parties.

The amounts outstanding are unsecured, interest free and will be settled on demand. No guarantees have been given or received. No expense has been recognized during the year for irrecoverable debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties.

Compensation of key management personnel
The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the period was as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2022<br>$'000</th>
    <th>2021<br>$'000</th>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>78,186</td>
    <td>77,896</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The remuneration of directors and key executives is determined by the directors of the parent company having considered the recommendation of the local Board and performance of individuals and prevailing macro-economic factors.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 30 - 60 days. The company has provided fully for all receivables due for over 180 days (2021: 180 days) because historical experience has shown that receivables that are past due beyond this period are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables outstanding between 30 and 180 days (2021: 30 and 180 days) are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience of the counterparty and an analysis of the counterparty's current financial position.

11. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)

Before accepting any new customer, the company uses a credit bureau to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed annually. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the reporting period, $117.25 million (2021: $60.29 million) (amount within the approved credit limit) is due from one (2021: one) of the company’s customer (See also Note 24(d)). There were no other customers who represented more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.

The company does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances, nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amount owed by the company to the counterparty.

In determining the recoverability of a receivable, the company considers any change in the credit quality of the receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the end of the reporting period. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the fact that the customer base is large and unrelated. The directors believe that, at the end of the reporting period, there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for expected credit losses.

The properties revaluation reserve arose on the revaluation of land and buildings prior to conversion to IFRS, and is shown net of annual deferred tax charges. Where revalued land and buildings are sold, the portion of the properties revaluation reserve that relates to that asset, and is effectively realized, is transferred directly to revenue reserve.

Financial risk management policies and objectives

By its nature, the company’s activities involve the use of financial instruments.

The company has exposure to the following risks from its use of its financial instruments: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

Financial risk management objectives

The company’s activities involve the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks. The company’s aim is therefore to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return and minimise potential adverse effects on the company’s financial performance.

The company has documented financial risk management policies which are directed by its parent company. These policies set out the company’s overall business strategies and its risk management philosophy. The financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects of financial performance of the company. The Board of Directors, directed by the parent company, provides written policies for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Periodic reviews are undertaken to ensure that the company’s policy guidelines are complied with.

There has been no change during the year to the company’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments.

Exposures are measured using sensitivity analyses indicated below.

(a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual security or its issuer or factors affecting all securities traded in the market. The company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currencies, as disclosed in Note 24(b) below, interest rates as disclosed in Note 24(c) below.

(b) Foreign exchange risk

The company undertakes certain transactions denominated in currencies other than the Jamaican dollar resulting in exposures to exchange rate fluctuations.

Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)

(b) Foreign exchange risk (continued)

Management of foreign exchange risk
Management consistently reviews the company's exposure in this regard by constant monitoring of international foreign exchange markets and factors influencing currency movements including daily analysis of its demand for foreign currency to meet supplier payments and positioning its foreign currency bank account holdings accordingly.

The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table details the sensitivity to a 1% revaluation and 4% devaluation (2021: 2% revaluation and 8% devaluation) in the Jamaican dollar against the relevant foreign currencies. The above sensitivity rates are used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the end of the reporting period for the above change in foreign currency rates.

If the Jamaican dollar strengthens by 1% or weakens by 4% (2021: strengthens by 2% or weakens by 8%) against the relevant foreign currency, profit will (decrease) increase by:

24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)

(b) Foreign exchange risk (continued)

Foreign currency sensitivity (continued)

This is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on bank balances, receivables and payables in the respective foreign currency at the end of the reporting period.

The company’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased during the current period mainly due to the decreased trade receivables and bank deposits as well as decreased payables denominated in foreign currencies.

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as at the end of the reporting period as it does not reflect the exposure during the period. US dollar denominated sales and liabilities are seasonal, fluctuating throughout the period.

(c) Interest rate risk management

Interest rate risk is the potential that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates as a result of cash flow or fair value interest rate risk. Financial instruments subject to fixed interest rates are exposed to fair value interest rate risk while those subject to floating interest rates are exposed to cash flow risk.

The company’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section at Note 24(e) below.

Management of interest rate risk
The company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring the movements in the market interest rates closely.

Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analyses are determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period. In respect of Jamaican dollar investments, a 100 basis points increase and a 50 basis points decrease (2021: a 300 basis points increase and a 50 basis points decrease) and for foreign currency denominated balances, a 100 basis points increase and a 50 basis points decrease (2021: 100 basis points increase and a 100 basis points decrease) is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

As at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the company had no significant exposure to interest rate risk.

24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)

(d) Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the company.

Financial assets that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and amounts due from related parties. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount of approximately $1,038.26 million (2021: $894.36 million) (excluding cash on hand) disclosed under 'categories of financial instruments' above and the company holds no collateral in this regard. Generally, the company manages its credit risk by screening its customers, establishing credit limits and the rigorous follow-up of receivables.

Cash and bank deposits.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are major banks with high credit ratings. The carrying amount of cash and bank balances (excluding cash on hand) totaling $258.93 million (2021: $275.16 million) at the reporting date represents the company's maximum exposure to this class of financial assets.

Trade and other receivables
The company has adopted a policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The company's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by management on an annual basis. Further, trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across the retail and construction sectors and as such, the company does not have significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty, except in respect of one (2021: one) retail entity whose outstanding balance at December 31, 2022 (within the approved credit limits) amounted to approximately 17% (2021: 10%) of trade receivables (see Note 11). Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of trade receivables. The book value of receivables is stated after allowance for likely losses estimated by the company's management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on days past due for various customers with similar loss patterns. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables are written-off if past due for more than 180 days and are not subject to enforcement activity.

The carrying amount of financial assets in respect of trade receivables totaling $693.57 million (2021: $532.38 million) and other receivables totaling $140.82 million (2021: $84.06 million) excluding prepayments at year end which is net of impairment of approximately $22.93 million (2021: $15.10 million, respectively), represents the company’s maximum exposure to this class of financial asset.

Amounts due from fellow subsidiaries
The directors believe that the credit risks associated with this financial instrument are minimal. There is no significant increase in credit risk associated with related parties and therefore the probability of default is considered insignificant. The carrying amount of $8.97 million (2021: $2.24 million) at the reporting date represents the company’s maximum exposure to this class of financial assets.

Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)

(e) Liquidity risk management

Liquidity risk, also referred to as funding risk, is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at, or close to, its fair value. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities. Due to the nature of the underlying business, the management of the company maintains an adequate amount of its financial assets in liquid form to meet contractual obligations and other recurring payments. The company also maintains a credit overdraft facility with a commercial bank to a limit of $90 million (2021: $90 million).

Liquidity and interest risk analyses in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities

The following tables detail the company’s remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the company can be required to pay.

Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)

(f) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities

The following methods and assumptions have been used in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities:

• The carrying amounts included in the financial statements for cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, due to immediate parent company and due from or to fellow subsidiaries reflect the approximate fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
• The carrying amount of lease liabilities (variable rate) is assumed to approximate their fair value.

Capital risk management policies and objectives

The company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the equity balance.

The Board monitors the return on capital (net income divided by shareholder’s equity).

The company’s Board of Directors reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As a part of this review, the Board of Directors considers the cost of capital and the associated risks. Additionally, based on recommendations of the Board of Directors, the company balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends.

The company’s overall strategy as directed by its parent remains unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2022.
