For the nine months ending September 30, 2023, the Group achieved improved revenue of $257.6 million, representing a $100.9 million or a 64% increase relative to the preceding reporting period in 2022. The strong revenue performance reported is mainly attributable to the execution of aggressive growth initiatives across both divisions. Operating profit for the period under review was $83.8 million, $54.4 million or 185% higher than that of the corresponding period of 2022. This sharp improvement in profitability is primarily due to continued growth in our revenue.

This increase reflects the Group’s ongoing commitment in growing operations and expanding all divisions through core business support areas, specifically staff cost, contractor cost and consulting fees. The Group achieved another profitable quarter, closing with a net profit attributable to shareholders of $75.5 million, a $91.6 million increase when compared to the preceding quarter in 2022.
