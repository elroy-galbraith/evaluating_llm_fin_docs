CARRERAS LIMITED
Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements
Three months ended June 30, 2022

1. General

Carreras Limited ("the company") is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica and is a 50.4% subsidiary of Rothmans Holdings (Caricom) Limited, which is incorporated in St. Lucia. The ultimate parent company is British American Tobacco plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom. The principal activities of the company are the marketing and distribution of cigarettes.

The principal place of business and the registered office of the company is 13A Ripon Road, Kingston 5, Jamaica.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

(a) Basis of preparation

This condensed consolidated interim financial report for the reporting period ended June 30, 2022, has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'.

These financial statements are presented in Jamaican dollars unless otherwise indicated.

The accounting policies followed in these interim financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period, except for the adoption of new standard, being IFRS 16 'Leases.' Changes to significant accounting policies are described below.

(b) Current year disclosures

The recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following asset:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Details</th>
    <th>1 April 2022<br>$'000</th>
    <th>30 June 2022<br>$'000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Freehold land, buildings and leaseholds</td>
    <td>227,870</td>
    <td>211,913</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The group incurred depreciation charges of $9,164,000 on the right-of-use assets and interest expense of $4,058,000 on the lease liability during the period.

CARRERAS LIMITED
Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements (Continued)
three months ended June 30, 2022

(b) Accounting estimates and judgments:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and the Companies’ Act requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of, and disclosures related to, assets, liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date and the income and expenses for the period then ended. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and/or various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. The unaudited financial results for the three-month period have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – Interim Financial Reporting.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

In particular, except for the impact of the application of IFRS 16 which is described under note 2 (b), the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements, or which have a risk of material adjustments in the next period are as follows:

(i) Key source of estimation uncertainty

Employee benefits:
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet and income statement for pension and other post-employment benefits are determined actuarially using several assumptions. The primary assumptions used in determining the amounts recognized insofar as the defined benefit section of the fund include expected long-term return on plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows required to settle the pension and other post-employment obligations and the expected rate of increase in medical costs for post-employment medical benefits.

Any changes in these assumptions will impact the amounts recorded in the financial statements for these obligations.

CARRERAS LIMITED
Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements (Continued)
three months ended June 30, 2022

It is reasonably possible that outcomes within the next financial period that are different from these assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.

(ii) There are no critical accounting judgments in applying the group's and the company’s accounting policies.

3. Significant Accounting Policies

Except as highlighted in note 2, the same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in the interim financial statements as compared with the most recent annual audited financial statements.

4. Operating Revenue

Operating revenue for the group and the company represents the invoiced value of products and services sold and includes special consumption tax aggregating $1,569,726,000 (2021: $1,512,084,000).

5. Taxation

Taxation on profit for the period is made up as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2022<br>$'000</th>
    <th>2021<br>$'000</th>

    <td>243,323</td>
    <td>290,718</td>
  </tr>
</table>

10. Impact of COVID-19

The impact of COVID-19 has been far reaching as it has caused significant impact on the major economies in which we operate, which are highly reliant on imports and exports for growth and development. The dislocation in sectors of the economy, such as the tourism, entertainment, retail trading and other areas is expected to have a negative impact on the Company’s potential growth.

The nature and extent of the impact on the Company’s financial position, results continue to evolve given the rapid pace of change and the elevated level of uncertainty.

In response to the specific financial risks identified, there are several measures employed, including robust monitoring of our receivable portfolio, managing investment portfolio, maintaining adequate safety stock levels and establishing alternative supplier chain arrangements.
