Report to the Shareholders

The board of directors is pleased to present the unaudited results of JFP Limited (the “company”) for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023.

Profit and Loss

JFP Limited had a challenging first quarter but is expected to rebound in the coming quarters. Revenue declined by 31% with the company falling below projections and ending with total of 75.8M. This decline was due to delays beyond the control of JFP’s production department. Two factors include changes to the design/build process and the logistics required to return to the work environment as the primary project pending finalization is located inside the local international airport. These jobs were originally forecasted to be completed in the first quarter. These delays had an impact on multiple areas of this quarters financials which will be addressed in this report. Cost of sales increased by 1% which resulted in a 45% decline in gross profit. Gross profit margin decreased from 70% to 56%.

Other income decreased by 119% resulting in a loss of 0.65M. This was mainly due to a decline in the value of equity shares held.

Administrative expenses increased by 18% which supported the larger staff complement compared to quarter 1 of last year.

Selling and distribution expenses declined by 18%. This was a result of decline in sales and hence sales-related commissions paid to external account executives.

As a result of the above factors, JFP experienced a net loss for the quarter due to the inability of revenue to fully support cost of sales and other expenses.

Balance Sheet

In terms of non-current assets, there were no purchases or disposals of fixed assets in the quarter, and non-current assets remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period last year. There was a slight increase due to the investment of funds generated from the IPO.

Inventory increased mainly due to work in progress component and the need to guard against shortages in inventory that might prevent the company from meeting customers' needs on time.

Receivables increased by 51% due to significant delays in collections in the period.

Cash and cash equivalents declined by 77% as the funds generated from the IPO last year were invested, resulting in a reduction in cash for this period.

Payables increased by 29% due to the delay in the collection of receivables.

Shareholders’ equity declined by 16% compared to the same period last year due to losses made in the last two quarters.

We, the Board of Directors, express our heartfelt gratitude to our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and all other stakeholders for their unwavering support and ongoing contribution in making JFP Limited a renowned name globally.

Chief Executive Officer

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

JFP Limited, (the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The registered office of the company and principal place of business is located at 155 Spanish Town Road, Kingston, Jamaica. Under Section 17 of the Companies Act, the Company changed its name to JFP Limited, effective 3rd December 2021.

The Company’s principal activities are the manufacturing and distribution of custom-built commercial furnishings and the financial statements are stated in Jamaica dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.

The Company’s shares were listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) on March 14, 2022. As a consequence of listing, the Company’s profit will be subjected to 100% tax remission for the first five (5) five years and thereafter, will be subjected to 50% tax remission for the next 5 years as long as the Company complies with certain Junior Market regulations.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

This condensed consolidated interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, Interim financial reporting.

The condensed interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these un-audited financial statements are consistent with those used in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

(i) Property, plant and equipment:

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

4. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (CONTINUED)
(ii) Depreciation:
Depreciation is recognized on profit or loss on the straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

(iii) Borrowings:
Borrowings are recognized initially as the proceeds received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost using the effective interest method with any difference between proceeds net of transactions costs and the redemption value recognized in income along with regular interest charges over the period of the borrowings.

(iv) Impairment:
Impairment provisions for trade receivables are recognized based on the simplified approach allowable under IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the expected credit losses (ECL).

5. EARNINGS PER STOCK UNIT
The earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the profit for the period by number of shares in issue for the three (3) month period of 1,120,000,000 (2022 – 1,028,222,222).

6. SHARE CAPITAL
Authorized:
10,000,000,000 shares (2022 – 10,000,000,000 shares)

Issued and fully paid:
1,120,000,000 shares (2022 – 1,120,000,000 shares)
