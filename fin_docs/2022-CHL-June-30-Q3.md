Management Discussions and Analysis

We are pleased to share the results of our performance for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 where revenue totaling $126.59M was achieved and represents an increase of 19% or $20.59M above what was achieved during the corresponding period in 2021. The increase in revenue this period is attributable in part to improving containerized cargo numbers post-lockdown in addition to the seasonal return of home-porting cruise vessel traffic into Montego Bay relative to the prior year. It is worthwhile to highlight that deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) via ISO containers have served to boost through-put and is positively influencing stevedoring revenue.

Operating Expenses for the quarter to June 30, 2022 amounted to $50.69M, an increase of 9% or $4M over the corresponding quarter which was consistent with the additional stevedoring activities that we have continued to experience over the 3-month period. Income derived from Cargo Handlers’ share of associate’s profit for the quarter amounted to $25.8M and improved resulting Net Profit to $96.16M before tax; this result was $27.5% or $20.73M above the corresponding quarter’s result in the prior year. These results yielded earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter and represented a $0.06 increase in share value when compared to the corresponding period in 2021.

External factors continue to pose a threat to the local economy, in particular the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the negative impact it is having on global commodity prices. We are mindful of the effect of these factors on global trade and despite the challenges we remain confident that the industry within which we operate, will be able to withstand and adjust to the associated shocks. While local demand continues to drive the majority of our cargo handling activities, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see a continuation of this into the ensuing two quarters providing there is no escalation of the aforementioned conflict and geopolitical tensions in Asia are kept in check.

The commitment of our team members continue to fuel our optimism that in spite of the uncertainties that are evident globally, Cargo Handlers Limited will continue to be responsive to the needs of our clientele in the context of an ever changing globalized environment. We remain focused on ensuring that we continue to pursue opportunities that will add value to our existing portfolio for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

4. Critical Accounting Judgments and key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Estimates and judgments used in preparing the financial statements of the Company are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has arrived at no judgments which it believes would have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in these financial statements. Also, management has derived no estimates for inclusion in these financial statements which it believes have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
