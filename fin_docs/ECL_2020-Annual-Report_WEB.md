Chairman’s Report

Ladies and Gentlemen,

What a year!

Express Catering Limited (ECL) started Fiscal Year 2019/20 very strongly, with projections surpassing all previous years. At the end of our third quarter, our revenue was shaping up to be the best since opening. However, unfortunately, the global pandemic at the beginning of our fourth quarter brought about a change in our revenues.

The Covid-19 pandemic affected our revenue stream severely. As was the case worldwide, tourism arrivals fell drastically and the situation was further compounded here in Jamaica by the closure of our borders. Departing passenger numbers at the Sangster International Airport fell by 16.96%. Accordingly, our revenues decreased by US$3.3m, a 19.08% decline. Net profit for the year was US$1.56m, a 58.18% decline. This was all as a result of the pandemic.

Up to March 2020 we employed over 300 team members to deliver the world-class service that we are known for. For this quarter, visitor arrivals were almost non-existent. As you are aware, the facilities and offerings of ECL were developed to satisfy our clients who are visitors to our island. With the severe drop in visitor arrivals, our revenue stream was greatly diminished. We had to make changes to our staff complement, our offerings and even had to close locations. We continue to be affected by the impacts of the pandemic, but we look forward to better days ahead.

With this outlook, we continue to make improvements to our product. MBJ Airports Limited, our landlord, continues to work on completing the revamped food court, of which we will be the biggest beneficiary. Three new concepts will be added to our offerings –
● Freshens which will serve signature smoothies, yogurts and other menu items
● Bento which will serve Japanese sushi, Bento boxes, poke bowls and more
● Bob Marley’s One Love which will serve Jamaican inspired food, fresh juices and more

We have also engaged the services of two leading industry players in airport design and revenue maximisation who are helping us to better streamline our layout and offerings. Great things to come!

As with the rest of the world, Jamaica continues to monitor and implement processes to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Indications point to the Government taking relevant steps to ensure that our industries and livelihood are protected. However every day the virus seems to present new challenges which requires immediate and sometimes unexpected responses. While there is great optimism that 2021 will be an improved year over 2020 mainly because of the Covid-19 vaccine roll out across the world and in particular our main source markets, i.e. United States of America, Canada, United Kingdom, it is uncertain when the turnaround will actually be a reality. We do however anticipate improvements in tourism arrival numbers this year especially in the second half of 2021.

We continue to ensure that all our brands – Domino’s, Aunty Anne’s, Quizno’s, Nathan’s, Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville, Starbucks, to name a few, operate at international standards and that all compliance and operational requirements are being adhered to. We also look forward to the better times ahead and stand ready to serve.

Thank you for your usual support. Looking forward to a better fiscal 2020/21.

Sincerely,

*End of Page 5*

The committee is currently comprised of two members who are both non-executive directors. The Audit Committee has complete access to the financial records of the group and has direct access to the Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Internal Controls and Systems and our External Auditors.

The Audit Committee meets on a quarterly basis to carry out their roles and responsibilities, inclusive of the following;

- Monitor the financial performance of the company against objectives.

Management Discussion & Analysis

The discussion and analysis for Express Catering Limited (ECL) that follows should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related financial statement notes found elsewhere in this report. The company reports on a 12-month basis from June 1 to May 31. Financial data is reported in US$, the functional currency of the company. The discussions are on the results for the year ended May 31, 2020 and comparative prior years.

Overview of Operations
ECL is a Jamaican registered company and a subsidiary of Margaritaville St. Lucia, Inc. The ultimate parent company is Margaritaville Caribbean Group Ltd (MCG), a Bahamian registered company. MCG, through its various subsidiaries and partnerships, own and operate a diverse portfolio of restaurant and nightclub concepts in Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos and St Thomas USVI. The group is the franchise operator of the Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville Restaurant, Bar and Retail Shops across the Caribbean.

ECL has been in operation since 2001, providing food and beverage offerings to the passengers that access the Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, Jamaica annually. It also provides food and beverage offerings for the approximately 5,000 employees that work in the various support services at the airport.

In 2011 Express Catering Limited successfully negotiated a long-term contract to manage and supply the majority of food and beverage offerings at the airport. Since then, ECL has been the dominant food and beverage partner of MBJ Airports Limited, operators of the Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay. The Company currently has exclusivity of food and beverage offerings for the post security sections. It also has a significant share of the pre-security food and beverage offerings.

The following International Franchises are currently under management by ECL at the Sangster International Airport:

These are complimented by a number of proprietary and local food and beverage brands such as;

*End of Page 12*

### Page 13

Three other international franchises were signed recently and will be added to the revamped food court that is currently under development. These new franchises are:

Bento, one of the largest sushi companies outside of Japan. The brand’s on-site Bento chefs prepare a selection of sushi, bento boxes, ramen, poke bowls and more. These fresh menu items can be enjoyed by guests onsite, or pre-packaged selections can be purchased at any of Express Catering’s Viva Grab and Go locations throughout the terminal.

Freshens, is a healthy “fresh casual” concept, serving signature smoothies and frozen yogurts alongside menu items with a focus on fresh and healthy options.

Bob Marley’s One Love, a one-of-a-kind, Jamaican restaurant drawing inspiration from Jamaica’s vibrant culture, food, music and spirit of generosity. Bob Marley’s One Love will feature an authentic pimento wood-grill, fresh juices, sharing plates, Marley inspired photo ops and more.

Up to the beginning of the 4th quarter, the company employed 305 staff on a continuous basis to assist in delivering the world class service that it has become known for. Unfortunately, as the Covid-19 outlook became more uncertain, we had to make the difficult decision to reduce our staff compliment in order to manage the cost outlays with the significantly reduced earnings.

ECL is a direct participant in Jamaica’s tourism industry as the company’s business model was designed to satisfy the demands of the stopover visitors that enter and exit the Island through the Sangster International Airport. The facilities and offerings were developed to meet the preference of the increasing number of visitors that come to enjoy the offerings of brand Jamaica. Stopover visitor arrivals numbers have increased every year up to 2019 as shown in the table below and so has the revenue and profits at ECL.

Sangster International Airport, in Montego Bay, and in close proximity to the growing tourism centers of Ocho Rios and Negril, continues to be the dominant entry point for visitors to the island. Of the 2.68 million stopover visitors in calendar 2019, 2.14 million or 79.74% entered through the Sangster International Airport. Kingston is the alternative point of entry for stopover visitors to the Island. The table illustrates growth in stopover visitors for all the years but at varying rates.

US$802,375
DIVIDENDS PAID OUT OVER THE YEAR.

Express Catering Limited has also contracted the services of two of the most respected companies in revenue maximization and airport design – Pragma Consulting (Pragma) and The Design Solution (TDS). Pragma is a leading airport retail merchandising and revenue development company that has consulted on food and beverage and retail programme development in airports around the world. The Design Solution has been deeply involved in the planning and design of commercial spaces within the airport environment for over 25 years. They have worked in 55 countries, 140 airports and over 175 terminals and will assist Express Catering Limited to analyze all its offerings with a view to maximizing revenue opportunities.

Effects of Covid-19 on operations
Throughout its existence, the company has not experienced a year that was similar to fiscal 2020. Up to the end of the 3rd Quarter, the company was on track to achieve its highest level of revenue as well as EBITDA for any fiscal year. Owing to the spread of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As was the case in most countries, our government took decisive action to immediately close the country’s borders until the factors of the pandemic were better understood. The closure of the Sangster International Airport affected all ECL’s businesses and has reduced the revenue and net profits to levels seen 4 years earlier. Total departing passenger fell by 76.19% or just under 500,000 for the fourth quarter. The company quickly adjusted to a cost containment and preservation mode to reduce spoilage and extra costs but were severely hampered by the uncertainties of the scope of the virus. The borders were subsequently re-opened however, there has been a steep decline in the number of stopover visitors, which is our main customer base.

Fiscal 2020 Highlights
Revenue for Fiscal 2020 was US$14.0 million compared to US$17.3 million in the prior year, a US$3.3 million or 19.08% decline. This was directly attributable to the closure caused by Covid-19.

The company adopted the new IFRS 16 on Leasing which became effective at the beginning of the fiscal year. The main effect was to recognize the liability for the future lease obligations relating to property lease as well as recognition of the asset relating to the right of use of the same property. US$ 24.7 million was added to both categories to satisfy the new IFRS 16 condition.

Net profit for the year was US$1.56 million compared to US$3.73 million in the prior year. The uncertainties relating to the scope of Covid-19 caused the company to incur excess cost during the last 2 months of the year when revenues were reduced to near zero.

The company declared and paid dividends of US$802,375 during the year.

The adoption of the new IFRS 16 on Leases has changed the category ratios and the comparatives. Lease payment formerly grouped under administrative expenses are now split with a portion remaining under administrative expenses in the income statement and the balance treated as Lease Obligation payments and adjusted against the liability in the Balance Sheet. The implied finance cost associated with the Lease Obligation is now included in the income statement under finance costs. The income statement is further impacted by the increase in Amortisation costs associated with the impairment of the right-of- use asset.

Revenues
Up to the end of the 3rd quarter, current year revenues were ahead of prior year revenues and the company was on target to achieve the highest aggregate revenue for any fiscal year. March has traditionally been the best performing month during the winter tourist season. The expectation this year was no different. However, at just around the middle of the best performing month, the WHO declared the Covid-19 a global pandemic and all activities came to a halt until June, except for a few special cases, when some amount of commercial activities resumed. Total passengers accessing the airport during the fiscal year was 3.70 million compared to 4.54 million passengers in the prior year, an 18.50% reduction. Total departing passengers were 1.86 million compared to 2.24 million in the prior year, a 16.96% decline.

MBJ Airports Limited commenced work on the food court expansion and rationalization project as planned. This initiative will see the addition of 4,000 square meters of food and beverage and retail space, inclusive of a redesigned food court. The new food court will have additional accommodation for diners and there will be additional flight information access points, thereby reducing customer anxiety while dining. ECL is expected to benefit substantially from this initiative.

Cost of Sales and Expenses
The third quarter report to shareholders mentioned that there was some negative pressure on Cost of Sales due to product mix but that the variation was within acceptable limits. The Covid-19 disruption in operations added to the variation but these were minimized by disposing of prepared items at cost. The company continues to benefit from the parent company’s bulk purchasing abilities and is able to hold just-in-time inventory, thereby reducing spoilage from excess inventory. In addition, the company is leveraging the experience gained over the many years in maintaining standards in usage of raw materials.

The company adopted the new IFRS 16 on Leases during the year. All leases that had in excess of 12 months before expiry and were material in obligation would have to be accounted for as a finance lease and the relevant lease obligation and right-of-use asset shown in the financial statements. As property lease payments were included in administrative expenses prior, the adoption of the new IFRS 16 had the effect of reducing this category of expense but it increased the finance cost as the lease obligation assumed a cost of capital as well as amortization charges because the right-of-use asset must be written off in line with the expiration of the lease.

Our staff and their safety are very important to ECL. During the first phase of the lockdown, the company made the concerted effort to ensure that all team members were adequately protected in terms of safety wear and provided with the required information that would assist in them remaining safe. Almost all staff were paid through to the end of May as the company tried to get a better handle on the duration of the border closings and the desire to be ready to serve our customers once the borders re-opened and travel resumed. This of course took on greater uncertainty as weeks passed. The company eventually had to make the difficult decision to lay off some of the team members with the hope that this would be short lived. We look forward to a return to normalcy.

The company benefitted from some relief from property rent charges during the initial border closing. This continued into the new fiscal year as the travel numbers have been considerably reduced. The need to cover staff costs and charges such as utilities and maintenance, common area maintenance and the cost to become compliant with the Covid-19 protocols all impacted the net profit position during the year.

Earnings, Earnings Per Share (EPS) & Dividends
Net Profits earned for the year was US$1.56 million. This produced EPS of US 0.09 Cents per share. Earnings in the prior year was US$3.73 million with EPS of US 0.22 Cents.

Shareholders received a total of just over US$802,375 in dividend during two distributions in the year, one in January and the other in March 2020. Amounts were paid from prior year retained earnings.

Balance Sheet Performance & Cash Flow
ECL invested a combined amount of US$387,000 for both fixed and intangible assets during the year. This was expended to replace fully depreciated restaurant equipment as well as upgrade display refrigeration in others. The post security lounge is currently being renovated by MBJ Limited to increase the available space for food and beverage as well as retail. ECL will have to relocate the existing offerings that are in the current food court. Some expenditure was made towards this initiative during the year.

The temporary deposit of US$707,000 included in Receivables at the close of the last fiscal year was repaid during the year so balances have returned to their usual levels. Inventories were reduced due to the downturn in business. There were also returns to the Corporate Office, that acts as supplier to ECL, due to the wider avenue for usage at that level.

Due to the significant downturn in business associated with Covid-19 and the uncertain outlook for the medium term, the company sought and received extensions on payment terms from the majority of our major suppliers. This will greatly assist in getting us through the medium term as current revenue levels are way below what is required to cover all obligations. Payables balance ended in line with prior year balances.

Future Outlook
Calendar 2020 will probably be the first in the last twenty years or more that Jamaica will record a reduction in stopover visitor arrivals. As ECL’s business model was developed around stopover visitor arrivals, the rest of calendar 2020 will continue to see substantially reduced revenue numbers. Our plan is to manage our costs within the reduced revenue numbers so that there is little or no need for cash injection.

As the world waits with anticipation for a vaccine to effectively manage the Covid-19 virus, the Jamaica Tourist Board is positioning Jamaica to be first in line in the Caribbean, once there is resumption of travel for leisure. MBJ Airport Limited is on track with the expansion initiatives at the airport that started during the year and which is expected to increase the passenger capacity. ECL too is doing its part in the expansion initiative by ensuring that our offerings are carefully curated to satisfy the international travel market.

We will be making a significant investment in fixed assets in line with the upgrading works being undertaken by the airport operator. There will be costs to relocate the existing restaurants into the new space, costs to build and outfit 2 of the new international franchises recently signed as well as costs to develop the third international franchise being developed. With the services being provided by TDS and Pragma, ECL’s input in the newly designed food court will be reflective of the level of facilities and services provided in top international destinations.

Independent auditor’s report

To the Members of
Express Catering Limited

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Express Catering Limited (“the Company”) which comprise the statement of financial position as at May 31, 2020, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at May 31, 2020, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement; were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters are addressed in the context of our audit of financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the annual report (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Express Catering Limited

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

Other information (cont’d)

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

Report on the Financial Statements (cont’d)
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that presents a true and fair view.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe the matter in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Sixto Coy.

Express Catering Limited
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended May 31, 2020

1. General information and nature of operations
The company was incorporated under the Laws of Jamaica on June 26, 2001. Its registered office is Unit 16 M19 Southern Cross Boulevard, Montego Freeport, Montego Bay.

Its main activities during the year were the operation of branded sports bars and restaurants at Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay. The company is a subsidiary of Margaritaville St. Lucia Inc, whose ultimate parent is Margaritaville Caribbean Group Ltd., a company registered under the Bahamas IBC Act of 2000.

The company was listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange in July 2017.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting policies and measurement basis summarised below:

a Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are expressed in United States Dollars (USD).

b Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in the current year

Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and became effective during the current financial year. The company has assessed the relevance of all such new standards, interpretations and amendments and determined that the following will have an impact on the company.

• IFRS 16 'Leases' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
IFRS 16, Leases replaces IAS 17, Leases, and the related interpretations, (IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease’, SIC 15, ‘Operating leases – incentives’, and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease’).

It introduces a single accounting model for lessees, which requires a lessee to recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except for leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less ("short-term leases") and leases of low-value assets. IFRS 16 defines a lease on the basis of whether a customer controls the use of an identified asset for a period of time, which may be determined by a defined amount of use. Control is conveyed where the customer has both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from that use.

The adoption of this new Standard has resulted in the Company recognising a right-of-use asset and related lease liability in connection with all former operating leases except for those identified as low-value or having a remaining lease term of less than 12 months from the date of initial application.

The new Standard has been applied using the modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 being recognised as an adjustment to the opening balances for the current period. Prior periods have not been restated.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)
b Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in the current year (cont’d)

For contracts in place at the date of initial application, the company has elected to apply the definition of a lease from IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 and has not applied IFRS 16 to arrangements that were previously not identified as lease under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

The company has elected not to include initial direct costs in the measurement of the right-of-use asset for operating leases in existence at the date of initial application of IFRS 16, being June 1, 2019. At this date, the company has also elected to measure the right-of-use assets at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments that existed at the date of transition.

Instead of performing an impairment review on the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application, the company has relied on its historic assessment as to whether leases were onerous immediately before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.

On transition, for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low-value assets the company has applied the optional exemptions to not recognise right-of-use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.

For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under IAS 17 immediately before the date of initial application.

The following is a reconciliation of the financial statement line items from IAS 17 to IFRS 16 at June 1, 2019:

  </tr>
</table>

The nature of expenses related to these leases changed as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.

• IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)

The interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes, when tax treatments involve uncertainty in the application of IAS 12. An entity must determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments. The approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty needs to be followed.

The adoption of the interpretation had no impact on the company’s financial statements.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)
c Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been issued, but were not effective at the statement of financial position date. The company have assessed the relevance of all such new standards, interpretations and amendments, has determined that the following may be immediately relevant to its operations, and has concluded as follows:

• Amendment to IAS 1 and IAS 8, (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020).

These amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, and IAS 8, ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’, and consequential amendments to other IFRSs: i) use of a consistent definition of materiality throughout IFRSs and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting; ii) clarify the explanation of the definition of material; and iii) incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

The adoption of the interpretation is not expected to have an impact on the company’s financial statements.

d Basis for measurement

These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for land and buildings that are measured at revalued amounts, or fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.

e Property, plant and equipment

(i) Carrying amount

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.

(ii) Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on the straight line basis at such rates as will write off the cost of the various assets over the period of their expected useful lives. The useful lives approximate to forty (40) years for buildings, five to ten (5 - 10) years for furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment, three (3) years for computers and five (5) years for motor vehicle.

Leasehold building and improvements are being amortised over twenty years.

(iii) Repairs and renewals

The costs of repairs and renewals which do not enhance the carrying value of existing assets are written off to profit or loss as they are incurred.

f Intangible assets

These represent amounts spent on the development of new products, processes and systems which is being amortised over 6 years.

g Functional and presentation currency

Functional and presentation currency

The financial statements are prepared and presented in United States dollars, which is the functional currency of the company.

Foreign currency translations and balances

(i) Foreign currency monetary balances at the end of the reporting period have been translated at the rates of exchange ruling at that date.

(ii) Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the dates of those transactions.

(iii) Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement of monetary items are included in profit or loss. Non-monetary items are not retranslated at year-end and are measured at historical rates except for those measured fair value which are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

h Revenue recognition

Revenue comprises revenue from sale of goods to customers. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and receivable, net of rebates and discounts and is recognised when customers are invoiced.

i Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all expenses, directly attributable to goods sold. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any related selling expenses.

j Cash and bank

Cash and bank comprise amounts held in current and savings accounts with financial institutions and cash on hand balances net of bank overdraft.

k Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. These are initially recognised at original invoice amount (which represents fair value) and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

l Owing to related company

Amounts owing to related company are carried at cost.

m Financial instruments

Recognition and derecognition

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

Classification and initial measurement of financial assets

Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable).

Financial assets, other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments, are measured at amortised cost.

The classification is determined by both:
• the entity’s business model for managing the financial asset
• the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are presented within finance costs, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of trade receivables which is presented within other expenses.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets

Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the assets meet the following conditions:

• they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets and collect its contractual cash flows
• the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The company’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.

Impairment of financial assets

IFRS 9’s impairment requirements use more forward-looking information to recognise expected credit losses – the ‘expected credit loss (ECL) model’. This replaces IAS 39’s ‘incurred loss model’. Instruments within the scope of the new requirements included loans and other debt-type financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, trade receivables, contract assets recognised and measured under IFRS 15 and loan commitments and some financial guarantee contracts (for the issuer) that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.

*End of Page 30*

### Page 31

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)
m Financial instruments (cont’d)

Recognition of credit losses is no longer dependent on the company first identifying a credit loss event. Instead the company considers a broader range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.

In applying this forward-looking approach, a distinction is made between:
• financial instruments that have not deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition or that have low credit risk ('Stage 1') and
• financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low ('Stage 2').
• ‘Stage 3’ would cover financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date.

‘12-month expected credit losses’ are recognised for the first category while ‘lifetime expected credit losses’ are recognised for the second category.

Measurement of the expected credit losses is determined by a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the expected life of the financial instrument.

Classification and measurement of financial liabilities

As the accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same under IFRS 9 compared to IAS 39, the company’s financial liabilities were not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 9. However, for completeness, the accounting policy is disclosed below.

The company’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdraft, trade and other payables.

n Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

o Income taxes

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the date of the statement of financial position, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding basis used in the computation of taxable profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

*End of Page 31*

### Page 32

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)
   o Income taxes (cont’d)

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

p Leased assets

As described in Note 2b, the company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore comparative information has not been restated. This means comparative information is still reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

For any new contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2019, the Company considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as ‘a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration’. To apply this definition the Company assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:
• the contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Company
• the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract
• the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use.

The Company assess whether it has the right to direct ‘how and for what purpose’ the asset is used throughout the period of use.

Measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee

At lease commencement date, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the statement of financial position. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Company, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).

The Company depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Company also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist. At the commencement date, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.

Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)
p Leased assets (cont’d)

When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to zero.

The Company has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets using the practical expedients. Instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability, the payments in relation to these are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on straight-line basis over the lease term.

Accounting policy applicable before May 31, 2019

The Company as a lessee

Finance leases
Management applies judgment in considering the substance of a lease agreement and whether it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset. Key factors considered include the length of the lease term in relation to the economic life of the asset, the present value of the minimum lease payments in relation to the asset’s fair value, and whether the Company obtains ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term.

For leases of land and buildings, the minimum lease payments are first allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of the respective lease interests. Each component is then evaluated separately for possible treatment as a finance lease, taking into consideration the fact that land normally has an indefinite economic life.

See Note 2(e) for the depreciation methods and useful lives for assets held under finance leases. The interest element of lease payments is charged to profit or loss, as finance costs over the period of the lease.

Operating leases

All other leases are treated as operating leases. Where the Company is a lessee, payments on operating lease agreements are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred.

q Impairment

The company’s assets are subject to impairment testing.

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.

Individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. All assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.

r Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares are included in equity as a deduction from proceeds.

s Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of current events and actions. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

There were no critical judgements, apart from those involving estimation, that management has made in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.

Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

Depreciation and amortisation are provided so as to write down the respective assets to their residual values over their expected useful lives and, as such, the selection of the estimated useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets requires the use of estimates and judgements. Details of the estimated useful lives are as shown in Note 2(e).

Expected credit loss

In assessing provision for doubtful debts, management estimates the recoverable amount of overdue balances. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future collectability of these overdue balances.

22. Risk management policies
The company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks in respect of its financial instruments: market (currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The company seeks to manage these risks by close monitoring of each class of its financial instruments as follows:

a Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The company is exposed to market risk through it use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risk, which result from both operating and investing activities.

i Currency risk and sensitivity

Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

However, the company’s financial statements are denominated in United States Dollar and as such there is no exposure to this risk.

ii Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the market interest rate. The company’s cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk. However, the company attempts to manage this risk by monitoring its interest-earning assets closely and procuring the most advantageous rates under contracts with interest rates that are fixed for the life of the contract, where possible.

Interest rate sensitivity

Due to the fact that interest earned from the company’s interest earning bank accounts is immaterial, there would be no material impact on the results of the company’s operations as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.

iii Other price risk

Other price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issue or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market.

The company is not exposed to other price risk as it has no investment in equity instruments.

b Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.

The company faces credit risk in respect of its receivables and cash and cash equivalents held with financial institutions. However, this risk is controlled by close monitoring of these assets by the company. In addition these deposits are maintained with commercial banks that are insured under the Jamaica Deposit Insurance Scheme (JDIS).

Receivables and other receivables

The company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses using a lifetime expected credit loss provision for receivables. To measure expected credit losses on a collective basis, receivables are grouped based on similar credit risk and aging.

The expected loss rates are based on the company’s historical credit losses experienced over the two year period prior to the period end. The historical loss rates are then adjusted for current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The company only grants credits to Airlines. The company experienced no credit losses over the past two years and does not expect to incur any credit loss based on its current business model.

The maximum credit risk faced by the company is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the end of the reporting period as summarised below:

  <tr>
    <td><b>Total</b></td>
    <td><b>363,761</b></td>
    <td><b>1,195,818</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

c Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting its commitments associated with financial liabilities.

The company manages its liquidity risk by carefully monitoring its cash outflow needs for day-to-day business and maintaining an appropriate level of resources in liquid or near liquid form to meet its needs. The company maintains cash and savings deposits for up to 30-day periods to meet its liquidity requirements.

The company’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, bank overdraft, preference shares and lease obligation. The contractual maturities (including interest where applicable) are as follows:

23. Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market (such as a recognised stock exchange) exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument.

Financial instruments that, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair value are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair values are observable, as follows:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. (Level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is derived from prices). (Level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). (Level 3).

The company’s assets and liabilities are measured at amortised costs and the carrying amounts for these are disclosed at Note 24.

25. Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) that are used to make strategic decisions.

The two operating segments are food and beverage which are normally priced together as a meal and therefore no segment reporting is disclosed in these financial statements.

26. Capital management, policies and procedures
The company’s capital management objectives are to ensure the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide adequate return to shareholders by pricing products commensurately with the level of risk and current market conditions.

The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

27. Impact of COVID-19
The spread of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has severely impacted many local economies around the globe. In Jamaica, as in many countries, businesses were forced to cease or limit operations for long periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. These measures significantly affected the company’s operation and resulted in its temporary closure as of March.

At the date of the authorisation of the financial statements, operations continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Management is unable to determine a reliable estimate of the financial impact of COVID-19 events on its profitability and financial position for the subsequent period.
