Review of 2nd Quarter
The company earned total income of $101 million in the quarter ended 30 June 2023 compared to $91.5 million in the prior year comparative period; an increase of $9.8 million (11%).

Revenues increased by $11 million or 13% and this was attributable to increase in revenues for the General (8%) and International (52%) Insurance Divisions. Employee Benefits and Individual Life Divisions both saw a reduction of 7% and 3% respectively, when compared to the prior year comparative period.

There was a reduction in Other Operating Income of approximately $1.2 million. We closed out the quarter with $2.6 million compared to $3.8 million in the prior year comparative period and this was primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange gains of $1.6 million.

Second quarter Operating Expenses increased by $11.3 million when compared to the prior year comparative period. Increase in Operating Expenses was largely attributable to Selling Expenses which increased by $8.9 million or 41.4% over the comparative period of 2022.

Finance related charges for the three months ended 30 June 2023 increased by $240,874 (24%), mainly due to interest charges on line of credit facility.

The net result was a Profit Before Tax of $1.04 million which was $1.76 million below the amount of $2.79 achieved over the comparative period of 2022.

Total Assets as at June 30, 2023 was $844 million compared to $760 million as at June 30, 2022, reflecting an $83.9 million or 11% increase. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, and property plant and equipment. These increases were offset against a $11.8 million (100%) reduction in right of use assets over the corresponding period.

Total Liabilities as at June 30, 2023 were $362.9 million, a reduction of $7.7 million or 2% over the 2022 corresponding period. This was mainly driven by a combined reduction in lease liability ($12.5m) and long-term loan ($14.7m) netted off against an increase in payables of $19.6 million.

Shareholders Equity continues to increase significantly, with the Company having Total Equity of $481 million at the end of the Quarter under review, which represented an increase of $91.6 million above the amount at June 30, 2022. The increase in the Company's total equity of $91.6 million was directly related to the increase in profits over the comparative period.
