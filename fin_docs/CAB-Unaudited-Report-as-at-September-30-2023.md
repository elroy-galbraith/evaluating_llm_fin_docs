UNAUDITED FINANCIAL REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

For the nine months ended 30 September 2023, Caribbean Assurance Brokers (CAB) reports unaudited net profit of $56 million. This represents a $48 million or 47% reduction over the prior year comparative period and is mainly attributable to commission adjustments to the International Comprehensive Health Insurance Programme (ICHIP), designed to enhance its sustainability. In effect, there has been a 40% reduction in the programme’s renewal commission rate, with a corresponding 40% increase in its new business rate, with the expressed intention of incentivising the production and consistent growth of new business. Therefore, while the initial result in the short run is a 40% reduction in the ICHIP’s commission, significant and consistent growth in new business is anticipated, due to the corresponding 40% increase in new business commission. The overall impact of these changes is a more robust, resilient, and sustainable ICHIP. Notwithstanding the economic climate, the company, based on market demands, continues to innovate and to develop additional products and services designed to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

Review of 3rd Quarter
The penultimate quarter of the financial year generated Revenue in the amount of $172 million, down from $222 million when compared to the prior year comparative period. The 22% or $50 million reduction in revenue was as a result of changes within the global market space. These changes had a direct impact on customer affordability, and the Company in return, afforded them the flexibility of making adjustments to the relevant product lines based on their specific needs.

Other Operating Income increased by approximately $15.9 million when compared to the third quarter of 2022. The quarter ended with $30.9 million in other income when compared to $15 million in the prior year comparative period. This this was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange gains of approximately $11 million in addition to an increase in interest income, $8 million.

Operating Expenses for the quarter under review amounted to $161 million. An increase of 18% over the prior year comparative period. This increase was mainly attributable to Administrative Expenses which increased by $22 million over the comparative period of 2022.

For the three months ended 30 September 2023, Finance Costs reduced by $379,158 (44%), mainly due to the reduction in interest on the company’s loan facility.

For the nine months ended September 2023, the company incurred increases in Operating Expenses of $31.9 million compared to results as at 30 September 2022. The 10% increase was largely due to increases in professional fees regarding training, compliance to the Data Protection Act, and system implementation costs.

The Company’s total Equity increased to $512 million as at 30 September 2023 representing a net increase of 10% or $45.8 million due to movement in net profit as well as recognition of dividend payment.
