Income Statement

Income
The company generated income for the first quarter of $900.3 million compared to $549.3 million for the prior reporting period. Gross profit for the year-to-date was $371.3 million compared to $191.7 million for the prior reporting period. These increases were attributed primarily to increased sales in eight (8) of our eleven (11) Product Groups as follows: Control Devices, Industrial, LED, Lighting World, PVC, Solar, Wires and Wiring Devices.

Administration Expenses
Administration expenses for the year-to-date was $195.2 million, reflecting an increase of $58.5 million on the prior reporting period amount of $136.7 million. The changes was driven primarily by increased staff related costs for salary adjustments, increased sales commission due to improved sales performance and improvements in staff benefits; increased occupancy cost due to the commencement of obligations for our new Fulfilment Centre at 76 Molynes Road; increased electricity cost; increased legal and professional fees; and increased depreciation due to increases in the carrying values of property plant and equipment. There were reductions in motor vehicle expenses.

Finance Cost
Finance cost for the year-to-date was $37.2 million compared to $31.8 million for the prior reporting period, an increase of $5.4 million. This increase is being driven primarily by increases in bank financing.

Net Profit
Net Profit generated for the period was $158.9 million, up $120.5 million or 314% compared to the $38.4 million reported for the prior reporting period.

Earnings Per Stock Unit
Earnings per stock unit was $0.32 up $0.24 or 316%, compared to the $0.08 reported for the prior reporting period.

Balance Sheet

Inventories
The company continues to closely manage inventory balances and the supply-chain, with a view to ensuring that inventory balances being carried are optimised, relative to the pace of sales, the time between the orders being made and when goods become available for sale, to avoid both overstocking and stock-outs. Monitoring is both at the individual product level and by product categories. Inventories have remained stable over both periods. The run-off of inventories reflected in Q1, is largely a function of the timing of new shipments.

Receivables
We continue to closely manage receivables with an emphasis being placed on balances over 180 days. We have implemented strategies to collect these funds as well as to ensure that the other buckets are managed. Seventy-two (72%) of receivables are within the current to 60 day category, up from the sixty-eight percent (68%) for the prior reporting period.

Trade Payables
Our trade payables are categorised by foreign purchases, local purchases and other goods and services. We have concentrated primarily on the foreign payables as the bulk of our inventories are sourced from overseas.

Non-current Liabilities
Non-current liabilities reflect a net increase of $120.9 million due to our booking of new motor vehicle and other bank loan facilities.

Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity now stands at $1,670.8 million, up from the $1,016.7 million at 31 December 2021. The increase of $654.1 million arose as a result of property revaluation gains of $495.2 million, and retained profits for the year-to-date amounting to $$158.9 million.

Our total shareholder count has increased to 2,054, up by 301 from the 1,753 at 31 December 2021.

Other Matters

Covid-19
In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic, and the Government of Jamaica declared the island a disaster area on 13th March 2020. The pandemic and the measures to control its human impact have resulted in disruptions to economic activity and business operations. This could have significant negative financial effects on the Company, our suppliers, our customers, and our financiers, depending on factors, such as the duration and spread of the outbreak, the restrictions and advisories from the Government of Jamaica and the governments of our overseas suppliers.

The prolonged epidemic threat increases the risk of economic slowdown, which may affect our financial performance. We continue to monitor and manage this risk.

We continue to adopt and implement all the safety measures being promulgated by the Ministry of Health & Wellness and have allowed our team members to work from home where practical.

Special Economic Zone Authority (SEZA) Application
We are happy to report that we have now met all the pre-conditions in our application for our new company, Blue Emerald Limited, to be registered under The Special Economic Zone Authority, to take advantage of the significant long-term tax concessions that are available. We are informed that our application received no objection from Tax Administration Jamaica and the Jamaica Customs Agency. Additionally, consultations were carried out with the Minister with responsibility for Finance and the Minister has offered no objection to the establishment of the Zone. The application is now with the Ministry of Industry, Investment and Commerce for consideration by the Minister. It is anticipated that this process will be completed within thirty (30) days and then Gazetted. Activities being undertaken at the new Hayes facility in Clarendon, will be done through this new entity acting exclusively for FosRich under a contract manufacturing arrangement.
