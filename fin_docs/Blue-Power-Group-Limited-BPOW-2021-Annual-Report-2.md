DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The Directors present this report including the Audited Financial Statements of the Company for the year 2020-21, to the Annual General Meeting.

This report deals with the results of the company after the separation of the Lumber Depot Division with effect from August 1, 2019. This was accomplished by the creation of a company called Lumber Depot Limited (LDL) which took over the assets and liabilities of the division and, in turn, allowed us to distribute to the shareholders of Blue Power Group Limited (BPG) the same number of shares of LDL as they held in BPG. Lumber Depot Limited (LUMBER) was listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange on December 16, 2019 after raising additional funds through an IPO. The company has its own Board of Directors headed by Mr. Jeffrey Hall as Chairman.

Since August 1, 2019, the company’s revenues have come from the manufacture of soap, rental of commercial property and the provision of management services to LDL. As such, for the financial year ended April 30, 2020, we have included the first quarter results of LDL as being from discontinued operations.

For the 12-month period, May 2020 to April 2021, total revenue amounted to $534 million, an increase of 10% over the $484 million realized in the previous year. Profit from operations was $58 million in the year under review, compared to $15 million in the previous year. Significant items to note are exports of $132 million and other income of $79 million. With the benefit of other income, profits before tax for the year amounted to $134 million compared to $73 million in the previous year, showing an improvement of 84%.

After-tax profits for the year were $107 million compared to $59 million in the previous year. We experienced a substantial gain in the value of our shares in LDL, resulting in a gain of $202 million in other comprehensive income, achieving total comprehensive income of $308 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, revenue was $99 million compared to $143 million in the previous year. Export sales during the quarter decreased from $33.27 million to $4.27 million.

The company has been very fortunate in avoiding any ill effects of the Covid-19 virus. The team has taken extra care in following the advice and directives of the Health Authorities. Our production and sales have maintained the levels achieved in the previous year.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

Organization and Structure

Blue Power Group, having divested its Lumber Depot Division, is now a company which manufactures soap and also earns income from rental of property, provision of management services to Lumber Depot Limited and income from investments in securities. It also holds a substantial number of shares in Lumber Depot Limited. Since April 2020, the company has graduated from the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange to become a full member of the Exchange and is treated as a “mature” company by the Jamaica Stock Exchange and the Tax Authorities.

Performance Summary

For the 12-month period, total revenue amounted to $534 million, an increase of 10% over the $484 million realized in the previous year. Profit from operations was $58 million in the year under review, compared to $15 million in the previous year. Significant items to note are exports of $132 million and other income of $79 million. With the benefit of other income, profits before tax for the year amounted to $134 million compared to $73 million in the previous year, showing an improvement of 84%. After-tax profits for the year were $107 million compared to $59 million in the previous year. We experienced a substantial gain in the value of our shares in LDL, resulting in a gain of $202 million in other comprehensive income, achieving total comprehensive income of $308 million for the year. The fourth quarter saw a significant decline in sales due to a lack of export sales. Total revenue was $99 million compared to the $143 million in the same period in the previous year. This resulted in an operating loss of $7 million for the quarter although the overall profit, with a substantial contribution from other income, was $24 million.

Administration at Blue Power Group

The administration of the company is being led by the General Manager Ms. Lisa Kong-Lee who continues to serve as Company Secretary. In the Accounting Department she is supported by Ms. Andrienne Jones, Chief Accountant. Mr. Vishwanauth Tolan joined the company in November 2020 and serves as Commercial Manager with responsibility for monitoring and streamlining production as well. Mrs. Monica Frater parted company with us in April 2021 and we send her best wishes for success in her new ventures.

A lawsuit has been filed in the Supreme Court of Jamaica by a company from Dominica against four Government agencies and BPGL seeking to:

1. Restrain the Trade Administrator and the Trade Board from issuing Certificates of Origin to BPGL and other soap manufacturers in respect of soap produced from soap pellets/noodles imported from outside of CARICOM.

2. Restrain the classification of soap noodles imported by BPGL under the Tariff code 38.23, and for declarations that the soap noodles/pellets were wrongfully exempted from the 40% Common External Tariff.

3. Direct the Commissioner of Customs and Excise and the Jamaican Customs Agency to apply the Common External Tariff of 40% on all soap noodles/soap pellets imported by BPGL and other soap manufacturers form outside of CARICOM.

4. Obtain a referral to the Caribbean Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the issues of whether: (a) The Certificates of Origin issued to BPGL were validly issued; (b) The Common External Tariff of 40% is to be imposed on imports of soap noodles by BPGL. The matters being raised by the lawsuit are issues of policy under the purview of the Government. However, it is important to clarify the matter of the tariff classification which we are required to use and for this reason it is useful to be a part of the defence which will be handled by our attorney Symone Mayhew, Q.C. She has filed our preliminary defence and will liaise with the Attorney-General’s Department.

It should be noted that all Certificates of Origin which had been issued to us have been recalled by the Trade Administrator’s Department. Our exports to Caricom have, therefore, ceased for the time being.

Promotion and Sales

Our relationship with Iberia Foods in the United States continues to be good. However, parts of two of our shipments have been detained by the FDA in the USA for review in relation to compliance with regulations. We co-pack for Eve Sales a laundry soap called BMC which is also gaining ground in the USA. Competitors from Jamaica and another Caricom country are also present in the market with very competitive pricing of laundry soaps.

In Jamaica, we value our relationship with Lasco which continues to be strong as we produce bathing and laundry soaps for the distributor under the brand names Lasco and Lascare. We hope to build on this relationship by introducing some new products towards the end of this calendar year
.
Derrimon Trading distributes Blue Power products in supermarkets and some wholesale stores although we continue to sell directly to some wholesalers in Kingston.

Pricesmart continues to be our most important retail customer with good sales of 18-pack laundry soaps available at excellent prices.

Miracle Corporation continues to support us through the purchase of True and Natural soaps for the domestic and Trinidad markets.

The issue of sales to Caricom countries has not been resolved as yet although we were supported earlier in the year by our Ministry of Industry and Commerce in obtaining Certificates of Origin for our exports. Almost all the countries in the region have very vibrant programmes to promote manufacturing and permit the importation of ingredients (raw materials) on a duty-free basis into their countries by “certified” manufacturers who are vetted and approved by Government authorities. What is most surprising is that not all products made by these “certified” manufacturers are allowed to be traded on a duty-free basis in the region because the rules of origin for Caricom require a different set of criteria to be met in order to qualify for duty-free trade within the region. This result, in many cases, leads to missed opportunities for production and employment in Caricom, lack of competition and extra imports from non-regional countries. We genuinely believe that the time has come for a complete revision of the Rules of Origin to promote greater production, employment and competition through trade.

Caricom Exports

Since our establishment as a soap manufacturer, we have strived to establish export markets in order to reap and pass on the benefits of scale and to cater to the product profile and quality expectations of the Caribbean diaspora wherever they reside. Over the course of 19 years, we have established a well-invested soap manufacturing plant and engaged and developed a skilled team to support the business. In addition to Jamaica, we are a significant player in the laundry soap market elsewhere in CARICOM and a number of distributors have come to depend on our products. Our business in CARICOM has involved the importation -- in accordance with the trade rules applicable to Jamaica -- of soap noodles suited for industrial purposes for manufacturing in accordance with our proprietary formulations and industrial processes. The finished packaged bar-soap products were then exported duty free to CARICOM markets. Recently, we have been advised that the use of imported noodles will disqualify our exports to Caricom for duty-free access. The consequence of this decision is the application of a 40% tariff on our soap products sold into CARICOM and this in turn will see a significant immediate reduction in our export business.

Our position as a company will be to consult with the Government of Jamaica and other stakeholders to review this matter in the interest of all stakeholders. At the same time we will re-focus our efforts to grow our business in Jamaica and other non-CARICOM markets (such as North America and the UK) in which we do not face the hurdle of a significant duty applied to our locally manufactured product. We will in the year ahead invest in modernising our plant and equipment to improve our overall product range, quality and price competitiveness in all of our markets. Our overall goal will be to preserve the market opportunities available to our business in Jamaica and ultimately to restore our export volumes over time.

Management continues to enjoy the support of the Board of Directors. The following table provides information regarding attendance at various meetings of the Board and Board Committees.

Risk Management

It is the responsibility of management to monitor and evaluate risks involved in the nature of our businesses. From the inception of our company, management has strived to be conservative by limiting or mitigating exposure while maximizing returns. During the course of the year, our monitoring resulted in extra security measures being instituted at Victoria Avenue. Since March, access to our compound has been restricted with all staff being subject to wearing of masks and temperature checks. We are committed to following the protocols announced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare with special emphasis in social distancing even while at work. Recent Committee and Board meetings have been held via zoom.

Our financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to enable management, directors and shareholders to provide an acceptable basis for comparisons between companies and over different time periods.

The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee have emphasized the need to take account of the rapidly changing local and global economic climate especially with respect to changes in the exchange rate and the need to limit credit exposure in terms of receivables.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Our approach has been to support community-based projects which provide and care for individuals at risk. Our contributions are often in kind through the provision of soap distributed by voluntary and religious organizations. The needs of the communities are enormous and we can only make small contributions to the overall effort but the rewards as well the expressions of gratitude encourage us to continue to be receptive to requests for assistance.

Effects of Covid19

Our production and sales were not affected by the curfews and closures which were imposed since March. Our team instituted stringent measures at our gate to protect our staff from being infected.

Support

We take this opportunity to thank our customers, our shareholders and our staff for their support over the course of the year and wish for them a safe and prosperous year.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
BLUE POWER GROUP LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the separate financial statements of Blue Power Group Limited ("the company") and the consolidated financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries ("the group"), set out on pages 25 to 72, which comprise the group’s and company’s statement of financial position as at April 30, 2021, the group’s and company’s statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the company as at April 30, 2021, and of the group’s and company’s financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants including International Independence Standards (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Other Information

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Other Information (continued)

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the Appendix to this auditors’ report. This description, which is located at pages 22 to 23 forms part of our auditors’ report.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is R. Tarun Handa.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
BLUE POWER GROUP LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
BLUE POWER GROUP LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report (continued)

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

BLUE POWER GROUP LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements
April 30, 2021

1. Incorporation and identity

Blue Power Group Limited (the company) is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The registered office of the company is located at 4 Victoria Avenue, Kingston CSO. The company is listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange and also has two wholly owned subsidiaries [see note 2(d)]. The company is a subsidiary of Antibes Holding Limited, a company incorporated and domiciled in St. Lucia. Antibes Holding Limited, in turn, is a subsidiary of McGowan Properties Limited, a company incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica.

The main activities of the group comprise the manufacture and sale of soap.

During the prior year, the company sold its Lumber Division to a related company, Lumber Depot Limited (see note 25).

2. Basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance:

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

(b) Basis of measurement and functional currency:

The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost basis (modified by certain items that are measured at fair value) and are presented in Jamaica dollars ($), which is the functional currency of the company.

(c) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty:

The preparation of the financial statements to conform to IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the reporting date and the income and expense for the year then ended. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are discussed below:

(i) Critical accounting judgements:

For the purpose of these financial statements, judgement refers to the informed identification and analysis of reasonable alternatives, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, and the well-reasoned, objective and unbiased choice of the alternative that is most consistent with the agreed principles set out in IFRS.

*End of Page 35*

### Page 36

2. Basis of preparation (continued)

(c) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued):

    (i) Critical accounting judgements (continued):

        The key relevant judgements are as follows:

        (1) Classification of financial assets:
            The assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual cash flows from a financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount requires management to make certain judgements on its business operations.

        (2) Impairment of financial assets:

            Establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward-looking information into measurement of expected credit loss (ECL) and selection and approval of models used to measure ECL requires significant judgement.

    (ii) Key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty:

        Allowance for impairment losses:

        In determining amounts recorded for impairment of financial assets in the financial statements, management makes assumptions in determining the inputs to be used in the ECL measurement model, including incorporation of forward-looking information. Management also estimates the likely amount of cash flows recoverable on the financial assets in determining loss given default. The use of assumptions make uncertainty inherent in such estimates.

    (iii) Net realisable value of inventories:

        Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realise. These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.

        Estimates of net realisable value also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held.

*End of Page 36*

### Page 37

2. Basis of preparation (continued)

(c) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued):

(iv) Residual value and expected useful life of property, plant and equipment:

The residual value and the expected useful life of an asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is accounted for. The useful life of an asset is defined in terms of the asset’s expected utility to the group.

It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are different from those assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.

(d) Basis of consolidation:

(i) A “subsidiary” is an enterprise controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Papine Properties Limited and Cotrade Limited made up to April 30, 2021. Cotrade Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Papine Properties Limited, which is owned by Blue Power Group Limited. The company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “the group”. These subsidiaries are currently dormant and the shareholdings are the same for 2021 and 2020. Cotrade Limited is the group’s nominee for holding properties from which the group manages its operations. The parent company administers the affairs of the subsidiaries and bears the related expenses. Papine Properties Limited is registered in the British Virgin Islands and Cotrade Limited is registered in Jamaica.

(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Balances and transactions between companies within the group, and any unrealised gains arising from those transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated to the extent of the company’s interest in the subsidiary. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

3. Significant accounting policies

The group has consistently applied the following accounting policies as set out below to all periods presented in these financial statements.

(a) Property, plant and equipment:

(i) Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss.

Gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in profit or loss.

(ii) Depreciation:

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis at annual rates estimated to write down the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values at the end of their expected useful lives. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or capital work-in-progress. Annual depreciation rates are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Assets</th>
    <th>Annual Depreciation Rate (%)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buildings</td>
    <td>2.5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Plant and machinery</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Furniture, fixtures and office equipment</td>
    <td>10 - 15%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Computers</td>
    <td>22.50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Motor vehicle</td>
    <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right of use asset</td>
    <td>8.3%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date.

(b) Investment property:

Investment property, which comprises freehold land on which no depreciation is calculated, and building is carried at cost, less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on building at the rate of 2½%.

(c) Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank balances and resale agreements.

Resale agreements are short-term transactions whereby the group buys securities and simultaneously agrees to resell them on a specified date and at a specified price. The difference between the purchase and resale considerations is recognised as interest income on the accrual basis over the period of the agreements, using the effective interest method.

*End of Page 38*

### Page 39

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(c) Cash and cash equivalents (continued):

Bank overdraft, repayable on demand and forming an integral part of the group’s cash management activities, is included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

(d) Inventories:

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost, determined on the weighted average basis, and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress comprises raw and packaging materials, direct labour, other direct costs and a proportion of related production overheads. In the case of manufactured inventories, net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

(c) Accounts receivable:

Trade and other accounts receivables are measured at amortised cost, less impairment losses [see note 3(g)].

(f) Accounts payable:

Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.

(g) Impairment:

Financial assets

The group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through OCI. The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the group considers reasonable and supportable information relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information. The group assumes that the credit risk on financial assets has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due.

The group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month ECLs.

- debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- other financial instruments (other than trade receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

*End of Page 39*

### Page 40

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(g) Impairment (continued):

Financial assets (continued)

The group considers a debt investment security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The group does not apply the low credit risk exemption to any other financial instruments.

12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.

The group recognises loss allowances for ECLs and considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to action such as realising security if any is held; or
- the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk.

Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive).

ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised costs are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

(g) Impairment (continued):

Financial assets (continued)

Presentation of allowance for FCI in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is the case when the group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Non-financial assets

The carrying amount of the group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets’ carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(h) Financial instruments:

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In these financial statements, financial assets comprise investments, cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Financial liabilities comprise accounts payable and due to related party.

(i) Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) – debt investment; FVOCI – equity investment; or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:

- it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.

▪ Cash and cash equivalents
▪ Trade and other receivables

Due to their short-term nature, the group initially recognises these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. The group’s financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities   Subsequent measurement and gains and losses:

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in the particular recognition methods disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item.

(iii) Derecognition

Financial assets

The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(h) Financial instruments (continued):

    (iii) Derecognition (continued)

        Financial assets (continued)

        The group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

        Financial liabilities

        The group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired.

    (iv) Offsetting

        Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(i) Employee benefits:

    Employees’ entitlement to annual leave and other benefits are recognised when they accrue to employees.

(j) Revenue recognition:

    A contract with a customer that results in a recognised financial instrument in the company’s financial statements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is the case, then the company first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual.

    Sale of soap

    Revenue is recognised at a point in time in the amount of the price, before tax on sales, expected to be received by the company for sale of soap supplied as a result of their ordinary activities, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled, and the product is consumed by and delivered to the customer. Invoices are generated and are usually paid for within 30 days.

    Customers obtain control of goods when the goods are delivered to and accepted by them. Revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered and have been accepted by the customers.

(j) Revenue recognition (continued):

Other income

Other income comprises mainly rental income, management fees and dividend income. Revenues are recognised at a point in time as the rental and management services are provided and when a dividend is declared.

Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The “effective interest rate” is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instruments to its gross carrying amount.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments, the group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a financial asset.

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

The effective interest rate of a financial asset is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset. In calculating interest income, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired). The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating rate instruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest.

(k) Net finance cost:

(i) Interest income arises mainly on bank deposits and is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, taking into account the yield on the asset.

(ii) Finance cost comprises material bank charges, foreign exchange losses and lease interest, and is recognised in profit or loss.

*End of Page 45*

### Page 46

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(i) Taxation:

Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is also recognised accordingly.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except to the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(m) Foreign currencies:

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are measured at historical cost, are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. Foreign exchange differences arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are measured at historical cost, are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates that the values were determined.

(n) Related parties:

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (referred to in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures as the “reporting entity”).

(a) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:

    (i) has control or joint control over the reporting entity;
    (ii) has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
    (iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.

*End of Page 46*

### Page 47

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(n) Related parties (continued):

(b) An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:

    (i) The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).

    (ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).

    (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.

    (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.

    (v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity.

    (vi) The entity is controlled, or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).

    (vii) A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).

    (viii) The entity or any member of a group of which it is a part provides key management services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.

(c) A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged.

(o) Segment reporting:

An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and for which discrete financial information is available.

In the prior year, the group had two reportable segments, as described below, which were the group’s strategic business units. The strategic business units offered different products and services and were managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies.

The primary reportable segments were:

(i) Soap division - Manufacture and sale of soap
(ii) Lumber division - Sale of lumber, hardware supplies and related products

*End of Page 47*

### Page 48

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(o) Segment reporting (continued):

Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.

Transactions between business segments have been eliminated.

As at April 30, 2021 (the reporting date), the group has no separate reportable segment as, in the prior year, the group sold one of its Lumber Division (see note 25).

(p) Discontinued operations:

A discontinued operation is a component that the group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the group and which:

- represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
- is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
- is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earliest of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.

When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and OCI is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

(q) Leases:

At inception of a contract, the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

*End of Page 48*

---

### Page 49

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(q) Leases (continued):

As a lessee (continued)

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the scheduled lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group is reasonably certain to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Leases under which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.

Assets acquired under finance leasing arrangements are measured at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses. After deducting interest attributable to future periods, the net amount payable is included in accounts payable.

*End of Page 49*

### Page 50

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(q) Leases (continued):

As a lessee (continued)

Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and were not recognised in the group’s balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessor

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

When the group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.

The group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of ‘other income’.

Generally, the accounting policies applicable to the group as a lessor in the comparative period were not different from IFRS 16.

(r) Fair value measurement:

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument. The group has no financial instrument that is carried at fair value and where fair value of financial instruments approximates carrying value, no fair value computation is done.

*End of Page 50*

---

### Page 51

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(r) Fair value measurement (continued):

The carrying values reflected in the financial statements for cash and cash equivalent, trade and other receivables, due from related party and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.

The fair value of amounts due from subsidiary and due from/to related party are assumed to approximate carrying value as both entities retain value least available to settle their liabilities to the company.

(s) New and amended standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective:

At the date of authorisation of the financial statements, certain new and amended standards are in issue but were not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the group. Those which may have an impact on the group’s financial statements are as follows:

• Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 16 Leases, is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and address issues affecting financial reporting in the period leading up to interbank offered rates (IBOR) reform. The second phase amendments apply to all hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.

The amendments principally address practical expedient for modifications. A practical expedient has been introduced where changes will be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate if the change results directly from IBOR reform and occurs on an 'economically equivalent' basis. A similar practical expedient will apply under IFRS 16 Leases for lessees when accounting for lease modifications required by IBOR reform. In these instances, a revised discount rate that reflects the change in interest rate will be used in remeasuring the lease liability. The amendments also address specific relief from discontinuing hedging relationships as well as new disclosure requirements.

• Amendments to IAS 37 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 and clarifies those costs that comprise the costs of fulfilling the contract.

The amendments clarify that the ‘costs of fulfilling a contract’ comprise both the incremental costs - e.g. direct labour and materials; and an allocation of other direct costs - e.g. an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract. This clarification will require entities that apply the 'incremental cost' approach to recognise bigger and potentially more provisions. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(s) New and amended standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued):

• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 cycle contain amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 16 Leases, IAS 41 Agriculture, and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

    (i) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments amendment clarifies that - for the purpose of performing the '10 percent test' for derecognition of financial liabilities - in determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf.

    (ii) IFRS 16 Leases amendment removes the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements.

The group is assessing the impact that these improvements and amendments will have on its financial statements when they become effective.

This represents the cost of a property owned by the group and is being held for investment purposes and therefore classified as investment property.

As at the reporting date, the Directors estimate the fair value of the property to be approximately $155 million (2020: $155 million) and has been categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on a March 7, 2019 valuation report of Valerie Levy & Associates Limited, Realtors and Appraisers of Kingston, Jamaica.

The most recent valuation of the investment property has been commissioned; however, the Directors do not believe that the fair value will be less than $155 million.

During the year, income earned on this property is $10,000,000 (2020: $7,630,420) from related companies [see note 12(e)]. Expenses incurred on the property are borne by the lessees.

5. Lease (continued)

(c) Extension options

The property lease contains extension options exercisable by the group up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where deemed appropriate, the group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the lessors. The group and the company assess at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The group and the company reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control. The group and the company have estimated that potential future lease payments, should it exercise extension options in these leases, would result in an increase in lease liability of Nil.

BLUE POWER GROUP LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements (Continued)
April 30, 2021

20  Taxation (continued)

(c)  Remission of income tax.

The company’s shares were listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock exchange, effective April 22, 2010. Consequently, the company was entitled to a remission of taxes for ten (10) years in the proportions set out below, provided the shares remain listed for at least fifteen (15) years.

Years 1 to 5        100%
Years 6 to 10       50%

The tax benefit therefore expired on April 22, 2020.

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company will retain the benefit of the tax remissions claimed in prior periods.

21.  Disclosure of expenses

24. Segment financial information

In the prior year, information regarding the results of each reportable segment for the first quarter of 2019/20 financial year is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before taxation, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.

As at April 30, 2021 (the reporting date) the group has no separate reportable segment as in the prior year, on August 1, 2019, it sold the entire Lumber Division and as a result the information included below for the discontinued operation are the segment assets; liabilities and other items for the three month period, May to July 2020 (see also note 25).

26. Financial instruments

The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

• Market risk
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Operational risk

The Board of Directors, together with management, has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s risk management framework.

The group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and group’s activities.

(a) Market risk:

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates interest rates and equity price will affect the group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

(i) Currency risk:

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

26. Financial instruments (continued)

(a) Market risk (continued):

(i) Currency risk (continued):

The group is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily on purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the Jamaica dollar. The main currency giving rise to this risk is the United States dollars (US$).

The group manages foreign exchange exposure by maintaining adequate liquid resources in appropriate currencies and by managing the timing of payments on foreign currency liabilities.

The table below shows the group’s main foreign currency exposure at the reporting date:

Exchange rates for the US dollar, in terms of Jamaica dollars ($), were as follows:

April 30, 2021 $152.25
April 30, 2020 $142.08

Sensitivity analysis

A 6% (2020: 6%) strengthening of the US$ against the Jamaica dollar would have increased profit for the year by $19,420,014 (2020: $14,547,997), respectively.

A 2% (2020: 2%) weakening of the US$ against the Jamaica dollar would have decreased profit for the year by $6,473,338 (2020: $4,849,332), respectively.

The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is done on the same basis for 2020.

(ii) Interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

Interest-bearing financial assets mainly comprise bank deposits and resale agreements, which have been contracted at variable interest rates for the duration of their terms.

26. Financial instruments (continued)

(a) Market risk (continued):

(ii) Interest rate risk (continued):

The group’s cash and cash equivalents and resale agreements are subject to interest rate risk; however, it manages this risk by maintaining deposits and negotiating the most advantageous interest rates. Interest rates on certain loan are fixed and are not affected by fluctuations in market interest rates.

At the reporting date the interest profile of the group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments

The group does not hold any financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Therefore, a change in interest rates, at the reporting dates, would not affect profit or loss or the value of the group’s financial instruments.

An increase of 100 basis points (2020: 100 basis points) in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased profit by $923,183 (2020: $165,292) while a 100 basis points (2020: 100 basis points) decline in interest rates at the reporting date would have decreased profit by $923,183 (2020: $165,292).

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2020.

(iii) Equity price risk:

Equity price risk arises from equity securities held by the group as part of its investment portfolio.

A 5% (2020: 5%) increase in the market price at the reporting date would have increased the group’s profit or loss and other comprehensive income by $16,414,452 (2020: $6,326,403) while a 5% (2020: 10%) decrease in market price would have decreased profit or loss and other comprehensive income by $16,414,452 (2020: $12,652,807).

(b) Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge its obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit exposures arise principally from the group’s receivables from customers and deposits held with financial institutions.

At reporting date, 96% (2020: 93%) of the group’s cash resources were held with one financial institution which is believed to be a substantial counterparty with a minimal risk of default. Otherwise, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial assets on the statement of financial position.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant market volatility which has increased the group’s credit risk. The increase in inflation rate, interest rates, unemployment rate and decrease in gross domestic product have resulted in an increase in the credit risk of cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amounts for these financials assets as at the reporting date.

Cash and cash equivalents and investments

Cash and cash equivalents and investments are maintained with financial institutions that are appropriately licensed and regulated, therefore management believes that the risk of default is low.

Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured at 12-months expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The group considered that cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk. Impairment allowances of $397,742 (2020: $125,424) was recognised on repurchase agreements as at the reporting period.

Impairment on long-term repurchase agreement and other investments has been measured on the 12-months expected loss basis. Information about the credit risk and quality of these financial assets are as follows:

Trade receivables

Management has established a credit policy under which its customers are analysed for creditworthiness prior to being offered with a credit facility. This includes credit evaluations on new customers and procedures for the recovery of amounts owed by defaulting customers. Management has procedures in place to restrict credit sales if the customers have not cleared outstanding debts within the credit period. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are categorised according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or company, or aging profile and existence of previous financial difficulties.

(b) Credit risk (continued):

Trade receivables (continued)

The group’s average credit period on the sale of its products is 30-60 days. Some trade receivables are provided for based on the estimate of amounts that would be irrecoverable, determined by taking into consideration past default experience, current economic conditions and expected receipts and recoveries. Management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of the customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which the customers operate. The customer is allowed up to 90 days after each invoice date to submit payment of amounts owing to the company.

Expected credit loss assessment

The group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on the data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and the available press information about its customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.

The group uses a provision matrix to measure ECLs on trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates.

Loss rates are calculated based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off current conditions and the economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables:

(c) Liquidity risk:

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group’s reputation.

Management of the group maintains an adequate amount of its financial assets in liquid form to meet contractual obligations and other recurring payments, and has a revolving line of credit in place on which the company can draw amounts when needed and repay without penalty.

The following are the contractual maturities of the non-derivative financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

(d) Operational risk:

Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the group’s processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors, other than financial risks, such as those arising from legal, regulatory requirements and other natural disasters.

The group’s objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to its reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.

The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to management.

(e) Capital management:

The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital as well as meet externally imposed capital requirements.

26. Financial instruments (continued)

(c) Capital management (continued):

The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which is defined as profit for the year divided by total stockholders’ equity.

The group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

(f) Fair value disclosure:

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and prepayments, amount due from related company and accounts payable are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.

The fair value of long-term investments and resale agreements, classified as amortised cost, are assumed to approximate amortised cost. The fair value of quoted equities is determined in the manner described in note 2(b) and fair values are disclosed in notes 6.

Determination of fair value and fair values hierarchy

IFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Mutual funds are valued using the pricing information received from the relevant fund manager.

Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.

The group considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.

The fair values of quoted equities are classified as level 1. The group has no level 2 or 3 financial assets carried at fair value.

27. Contingent liability

DCP Successors Limited, a company incorporated in Dominica, has filed a claim against certain Government of Jamaica (GOJ) entities, and Blue Power Group Limited (the company) in the Supreme Court of Jamaica. The claim principally relates to the issue of certificates of origin by agencies of the Government of Jamaica to Jamaican producers of soap in respect of soap exports to other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states, and the tariff applicable to imports of certain raw materials for soap, from outside of CARICOM.

On the advice of independent legal counsel, management has assessed no immediate adverse effect on the business of Blue Power Group Limited as a going concern or on its financial position.

28. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The World Health Organization declared the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) declared the island a disaster area on March 13, 2020.

The pandemic and the measures to control its human impact have resulted in significant disruptions to the group’s principal trading activities and business operations.

In light of the heightened concerns and in accordance with the directives of the GOJ, to minimize the potential exposure to the group’s staff and partners, whilst ensuring that any disruption to the group activities are kept at a minimum, management pursued appropriate mitigation strategies. During the year, staff were equipped with hand sanitizers, masks and gloves (where necessary), and were required to comply with mandated social/physical distancing rules. The group ensures that it remains compliant with government/public health restrictions and attendant mitigating measures.

Management continues to monitor the effect of developments arising from the pandemic on the risks faced by the group. In the review of the pandemic’s effect on the group’s business since the reporting date, management has not identified any material adverse impact on the group’s operations.
