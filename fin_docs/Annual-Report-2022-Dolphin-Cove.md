Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share with you the highlights of our performance in 2022. Despite the challenges posed by the hangover of the Omicron variant in the first quarter of 2022, we managed to have a fantastic remainder of the year, ending the twelve months with more visitors than we had in the full year of 2019, the last pre Covid year.

The cruise segment was the main driver of this success, as we experienced substantial growth in sales per vessel arrival. At the same time, the hotel sector showed steady recovery, and the exponential growth of the local market helped us achieve 2022’s excellent results.

Our ability to control costs and expenses played a crucial role in improving our results. We remain committed to continuing our work with creativity, service, teamwork, and innovation, and to contribute to Jamaica’s tourism sector by creating and sharing unforgettable experiences in harmony with the environment.

Our revenue in 2022 increased by 99% compared to 2021 and 2% compared to 2019, reflecting the recovery of the tourism sector in the second quarter onwards. We made larger investments in publicity and promotion for direct channels such as the local market and online sales.

Our gross margin in 2022 was 89%, 1% higher than the previous year and 2019. We operated under a highly efficient structure, and despite the significant increase in expenditure year-over-year, our overall expenses in 2022 was 12% less than for 2019.

The company's strong financial position allowed us to declare and pay a total dividend of 80 cents during the year, the most significant payment made by Dolphin Cove. We generated US$5.6 million in cash flows from operating activities and were able to place US$1 million in a short-term investment facility.

Letter from the CFO of The Dolphin Company

To all our shareholders, and every member of the Dolphin Cove’s family.

I am pleased to present the Annual Report for the performance in the year 2022. After a year of transition and come back as 2021, Dolphin Cove entered in 2022 with the vision of consolidating our execution and show improvement in opportunity areas detected in the past months.

The start was not easy, in the first two months of the year our results were impacted by the appearance of Omicron variant, however, the operating efficiency achieved over the previous months and the resilience of our Company allowed us to sort this difficult period and continue our path with improvements in our performance during the rest of the year.

Despite the uncertain start experienced in January and February, the market conditions in the remaining months were improving. With better conditions and with our good management and ability to turn all challenges into opportunities to enhance our execution, Dolphin Cove delivered the greatest results in its history by generating $15 million in revenue and ending the year with a net profit of $2.9 million.

This extraordinary performance was reflected also in the cash flow, the Company generated US$5.6 million from operating activities, which allowed us to pay a total dividend of 80¢ in the year, the largest amount ever. On the other hand, the cash generated also allowed us to make important investment in CAPEX to enhance our existing product and to offer new attractions to our guests that we expect to generate meaningful growth in 2023.

Transfer Between Facilities

Dolphin Cove, always seeking first and foremost the welfare of our dolphin family, carried out an exchange of two dolphins between the Moon Palace and Ocho Rios facilities. This move was made to keep one of our juveniles from Moon Palace with another group of juveniles in Ocho Rios, in order to enhance natural behaviors among our youngsters.

The transport was carried out under the supervision of our marine mammal specialists and veterinarians following all safety protocols.

Research 2022

Thanks to the knowledge we have gained through our dolphin ambassadors about the physiology, biology and common pathologies of cetaceans, Dolphin Cove began a study in 2022 to promote preventive medicine in dolphins. The results obtained during the year have been very promising, finding ways to prevent some infections and other common pathologies in this species. Due to the success obtained at Dolphin Cove facilities, the study was expanded to other parks within The Dolphin Company in countries such as the USA and the Dominican Republic by the end of 2022. This study is still ongoing.

“For 2022, even though in Q1 our operation was affected by the Omicron variant we managed to have a very good performance from April onwards, thus closing the year with more visitors than 2019. The cruise segment was the main driver of these results, in spite of the lesser calls vs 2019 we had a great growth in sales per arrival and therefore better efficiency in this segment; on the other hand, the continued recovery of the hotel sector and the exponential growth of the local market helped us to obtain excellent results for this year.

Controlling our costs and expenses continues to be a very important factor in improving our results. For 2023, we will continue to work with the creativity, service, teamwork and innovation that characterizes us, and keep contributing to jamaica’s tourism sector, creating and sharing unforgettable experiences in harmony with the environment”.

Statement of Profit & Loss & Other Comprehensive Income

Revenue

After a hesitant and uncertain start, the tourism sector entered into a stabilization process in the second quarter and showed a constant recovery through the rest of the year. Dolphin Cove capitalized the better conditions of the market with a larger investment in publicity and promotion for direct channels such as local market and online sales; in addition to this, the excellent relationship with important players both locally and at a corporate level helped us to improve in the generation of revenue.

The Company reported US$15.1 million in revenue, where Dolphin and Other Interactive Programs had a participation of 51%, revenue from ancillary services such as the Photo Income, Boutique, Food and Beverage and Other Tours and activities represented 49%.

Revenue in 2022, increased by US$7.5 million or 99% vs 2021 and US$0.2 million or 2% when compared to 2019.

Operating Expenses

The result for 2022 reflects an increase in operating expenses of US$4.3 million or 87% vs 2021, this is due mainly to the greater attendance in all the parks and habitats, which demands higher level of expenditure in items such as payroll, park keeping, consumables and supplies. Also, the inflation pressures caused an increase in some key items needed in our daily operation as fuel, utilities, transportation rates which had an impact in the increase in expenses year-over-year.

With better conditions in the tourism sector, the management of Dolphin Cove increased the funds destined to the promotion and selling of our different interactive programs and tours which represented US$1.8 million more compared to 2021.

Despite the large increase in expenditure year-over-year, the cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past 2 years allowed us to operate under a very efficient structure, as a result of this, our overall expenses in 2022 ended with a reduction of US$1.3 million or 12% compared to 2019.

07. Management Discussion & Analysis

2015 – 2022 Net Working Capital

"In 2022, the Company generated US$15.1 million in revenue, driven by 2 factors: 1) The recovery of cruise ship business and our improved efficiency in sales. 2) The strategic investments in renovation work and addition of in-park sales. On the other hand, all permanent efficiencies achieved in the beginning of the pandemic and the strict discipline in the use of resources resulted in US$91 million in operating expenses, US$1.3 million less than 2019, even with same number of visitors and volume of business.

The combination of the great performance in the top line and the good management of resources resulted in meaningful growth in the net profit, we ended the year with nearly US$3 million, the largest profit of Dolphin Cove’s history, even without the tax benefit which expired in 2020.

The Company ended the year with a strong balance sheet, net working capital increased nearly US$800,000 year-over-year, driven mainly by the good collections gestion. Dolphin Cove ended the year with US$1.6 million in cash and was able to allocate US$1 million in a short-term investment facility even after the CAPEX exercised during the year and the payment of two dividend of 40 cents each.

I am very pleased with the financial performance of the Company, all efforts made over the past years to transform and streamline our processes, the flexibility and the experience acquired to operate under unusual circumstances couple with much better market conditions, led us deliver the best financial performance of Dolphin Cove to date.

Despite the extraordinary numbers achieved in 2022, there is still room to improve our execution and enhance our profitability, i am confident that with the passion of our associates, the well-experienced management team, the guidance of our Board of Directors and the support of our shareholders, all ingredients are on the table to see even better results in the upcoming 2023."

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
DOLPHIN COVE LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Dolphin Cove Limited ("the Company") comprising the separate financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries ("the Group"), set out on pages 7 to 63 which comprise the Group’s and Company’s statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, the Group’s and Company’s statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Company as at December 31, 2022, and of the Group’s and Company’s financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS Standards) and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants including International Independence Standards (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
DOLPHIN COVE LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.

Key audit matter

1. Valuation of trade and other receivables

The Group is required to recognise expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables, the determination of which is highly subjective and requires management to make significant judgement and estimates including determination of the appropriate variables and assumptions used and the application of forward-looking information.

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our procedures in this area included:
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies based on requirements of IFRS 9, our business understanding and industry practice.
• Identifying and testing relevant controls and evaluating reliance thereon or otherwise.
• Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s key judgements in estimating ECLs, including selection and application of methods, models, assumptions and data sources.
• Challenging significant assumptions and judgements relating to the inputs and economic parameters used for the ECL measurement.
• Evaluating the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the data.
• Evaluating the appropriateness and testing the mathematical accuracy of the ECL model applied.
• Evaluating the completeness, accuracy and relevance of disclosures required by IFRS 9, including disclosures about assumptions about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty.

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Standards and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
DOLPHIN COVE LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the Appendix to this auditors’ report. This description, which is located at pages 5 and 6, forms part of our auditors’ report.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Wilbert Spence.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
DOLPHIN COVE LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report (Continued)

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

• Amendments to IAS 37 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets clarify those costs that comprise the costs of fulfilling the contract and were effective January 1, 2022.

(ii) Forthcoming standards:

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new and amended standards have been issued which are not effective at the reporting date and which the Group has not early adopted.

• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, will apply retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments promote consistency in application and clarify the requirements on determining if a liability is current or non-current.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance (continued):
New and amended standards (continued):
(ii) Forthcoming standards (continued):

• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (continued)

Under existing IAS 1 requirements, entities classify a liability as current when they do not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Instead of the requirement for a right of deferral to be “unconditional”, the standard requires that a right to defer settlement must have “substance” and exist at the end of the reporting date. An entity classifies a liability as non-current if it has a right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date. It has also been clarified that a right to defer exists only if the entity is in compliance with conditions specified in the loan agreement at the reporting date, even if the lender does not test compliance until a later date.

The Group will apply the amended standards for the reporting period starting January 1, 2024. The amended standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.

• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and may be applied earlier. The amendments help entities provide useful accounting policy disclosures.

The key amendments to IAS 1 include:

- requiring entities to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies;
- clarifying that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions are themselves immaterial and as such need not be disclosed; and
- clarifying that not all accounting policies that relate to material transactions, other events or conditions are themselves material to a company’s financial statements.

The amendments are consistent with the refined definition of material:

“Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements”.

The Group will apply the amended standards for the reporting period starting January 1, 2023, with changes in disclosures in accounting policies expected.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance (continued):

New and amended standards (continued):

(ii) Forthcoming standards (continued):

• Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments introduce a new definition for accounting estimates; clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.

The amendments also clarify the relationship between accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that a company develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy.

Developing an accounting estimate includes both:

- selecting a measurement technique (estimation or valuation technique) – e.g. an estimation technique used to measure a loss allowance for expected credit losses when applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and

- choosing the inputs to be used when applying the chosen measurement technique – e.g. the expected cash outflows for determining a provision for warranty obligations when applying IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

The effects of changes in such inputs or measurement techniques are changes in accounting estimates. The definition of accounting policies is unchanged.

The Group will apply the amendments for the reporting period starting January 1, 2023. The amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.

• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments clarify how entities should account for deferred tax on certain transactions – e.g. leases and decommissioning provisions.

The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption (IRE) so that it does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. As a result, companies will need to recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease and a decommissioning provision.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance (continued):

New and amended standards (continued):
(ii) Forthcoming standards (continued):

Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (continued)

For leases and decommissioning liabilities, the associated deferred tax asset and liabilities will need to be recognised from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. If an entity previously accounted for deferred tax on leases and decommissioning liabilities under the net approach, then the impact on transition is likely to be limited to the separate presentation of the deferred tax asset and the deferred tax liability.

For all other transactions, the amendments apply to transactions that occur after the beginning of the earliest period presented.

The Group will apply the amendments for the reporting period starting January 1, 2023. The amended standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.

(b) Basis of measurement and functional currency:

The financial statements are prepared on the historic cost basis, except for land and buildings which are carried at market value. The financial statements are presented in United States dollars ($), which is the functional currency of the Company.

(c) Use of estimates and judgements:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are discussed below:

Judgements

For the purpose of these financial statements, judgement refers to the informed identification and analysis of reasonable alternatives, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, and the well-reasoned, objective and unbiased choice of the alternative that is most consistent with the agreed principles set out in IFRS. The significant judgement exercised by Management in the preparation of these financial statements is in respect of the useful lives of the dolphins. The useful lives of dolphins vary, and management used its judgement in determining an average, expected useful life of 30 years see note 3(h).

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation (continued)

(c) Use of estimates and judgements (continued):

Key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty

(i) Impairment of receivables:

The impairment allowance for trade and other receivables is determined upon origination of the trade accounts receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss ("ECL") of the receivables.

Under this ECL model, the Group segments its receivables in a matrix by days past due and determined for each age bracket an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 12 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable. The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the segment of 91 days or more past due. The use of assumptions make uncertainty inherent in such estimates [see note 3(n)].

(ii) Fair value of land and buildings:

Land and buildings are revalued annually to fair market value at each reporting date. These valuations are conducted periodically by independent professional valuers, using recent selling prices of comparable properties.

However, as no two properties are exactly alike, adjustments are made to reflect differences between properties. Consequently, the determination of fair market value of the property requires that the valuers analyse the differences in relation to age and physical condition, time of sale, land to building ratio, the advantages and disadvantages of the location and other functional gains to be derived from the property, and make necessary adjustments (see note 9).

(d) Basis of consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the separate financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (note 1), made up to December 31, 2022. The financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

(i) Subsidiaries:

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.

(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation:

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

3. Significant accounting policies

(a) Foreign currencies:

Foreign currency transactions and balances:

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the United States dollar ($) at the rates of exchange at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined.

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of those transactions. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Gains and losses arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are generally included in profit or loss. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of equity investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in other comprehensive income, except on impairment in which case the foreign currency differences that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

(b) Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank including short-term deposits, where the original maturities of such deposits do not exceed three months.

(c) Investments:

Fixed deposits are classified and measured at amortised cost. The Group intends to hold the assets to maturity to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(d) Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable comprising trade and other receivables and are measured at amortised cost, less impairment losses.

(e) Related parties:

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (referred to in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, as the "reporting entity" in his case the Group).

(g) Property, plant and equipment:

(i) Recognition and measurement:

Land and buildings are measured at valuation, less subsequent depreciation. All other categories of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of land and buildings is credited to capital reserves through other comprehensive income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously charged. A decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and buildings is charged to profit or loss to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in capital reserve relating to a previous revaluation of such assets.

On a sale or retirement of the revalued asset, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in unrealised capital reserve is transferred directly to realised reserve.

Cost includes expenditures that are attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is probable that the future economic benefit embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.

The costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related costs to put the asset into service. Borrowing costs, including but not limited to, interest on borrowings and exchange differences arising on such borrowings, that are directly attributable to the acquisition and/or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete. Thereafter, borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss when they are incurred.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.

(g) Property, plant and equipment (continued):

(i) Subsequent expenditure:

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group.

(ii) Depreciation:

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on the straight-line basis computed at annual rates estimated to write down the assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Assets</th>
    <th>Useful Life</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buildings</td>
    <td>40 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>10 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Motor vehicles</td>
    <td>5 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dune buggies</td>
    <td>3 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

No depreciation is charged on land and capital work-in-progress. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

(h) Live assets:

This comprises of dolphins and other marine life, as well as birds and are measured at cost, less amortisation. Dolphins and other marine life are amortised over periods not exceeding thirty years and fifteen years, respectively.

The costs of dolphins (calves) are accumulated from the date the mothers are pregnant and include food, medicine, veterinary services, special care and training of the calves. Directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are capitalised until calves are brought into production. These costs are then amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding thirty years. Dolphins purchased are capitalised at the acquisition cost which is amortised over a period not exceeding thirty years on the straight-line basis. The useful life of thirty years for the dolphins is based on research done on dolphins and the experience of the Group. These live assets are not held for agricultural purposes.

(i) Leases:

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(i) Leases (continued):

As a lessee (continued)

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

COVID-19-related rent concessions

The Group negotiated a rent concession with its landlord as a result of the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year.

The Group has applied COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions-Amendments to IFRS 16, applying the practical expedient allowing it not to assess whether eligible rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are lease modifications.

(j) Accounts payable:

Accounts payable comprising trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.

(k) Provisions:

A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the obligation.

(l) Interest bearing borrowings:

Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest basis.

(m) Share capital and dividends:

Ordinary shares are classified as equity and carried at cost. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.

Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

(n) Impairment:

(i) Non-financial assets:

The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

- Calculation of recoverable amount:

The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

- Reversal of impairment:

An impairment loss is reversed, if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Measurement of ECLs

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost.

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information.

The Group assumes that the credit risk on financial assets has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due.

The Group recognises loss allowances for ECLs and considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to action such as realising security if any is held; or
- the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

Life-time ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).

ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised costs are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

(ii) Financial assets (continued):

Credit-impaired financial assets (continued)

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in 'impairment losses on financial instruments' in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

(o) Revenue recognition:

Revenue from services is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of volume rebates and sales taxes.

        Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.

        Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

    (ii) Deferred tax:
        Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date.

        A deferred tax liability is recognised for taxable temporary differences, except on the initial recognition of goodwill and to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

        A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(t) Segment reporting:

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Each operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Group has identified the Managing Director as its CODM.

(t) Segment reporting (continued):
During the year, a review of operating segments was conducted. Based on the economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors the operations, the Group has concluded that its operating segments should be aggregated and that it has only one operating segment.

(u) Financial instruments:
Recognition and initial measurement
Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets
The financial assets that meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss: a) are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and b) its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as “Held to collect” and measured at amortised cost.

Amortised cost represents the net present value (“NPV”) of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:

▪ Cash and cash equivalents
▪ Investments
▪ Trade and other receivables
▪ Due from related companies
▪ Due from parent company
▪ Due from subsidiaries

Due to their short-term nature, the Group initially recognises these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses.

Subsequent measurement
The Group’s financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment on financial assets are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

(n) Financial instruments (continued):

Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)

Derecognition

A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities, which include payables and accruals, bank borrowings and lease obligations, due to other related companies and long-term liabilities are recognised initially at fair value.

Subsequent measurement

Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position if there is currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(v) Fair value measurement:

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

When available, the fair value of an instrument is measured by using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, valuation techniques are used that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

• Level 1 – Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.

• Level 2 – Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).

• Level 3 – Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation.

This represents payment for constructing a new dolphin encounter park in St. Lucia on behalf of the Company. The amount provided constitutes 40% of the estimated project cost [see note 26(a)]. The project has not advanced due to the unfavorable market conditions in the Caribbean region resulting from Covid-19, particularly in the Cruise Line business, which is the primary source of St. Lucia’s revenue. As at December 31, 2022, there has been no further progress on the project and management is in discussion for its resumption. Once the project has started, the amount will be treated as capital work-in-progress as part of property, plant and equipment. In the event of cancellation, Dolphin Discovery, Inc. is obliged to return the advance to the Company.

(a) The Group’s and Company’s land and buildings were revalued as at December 31, 2018 on an open market basis by Property Consultants Limited (an independent firm of registered real estate agents, appraisers, auctioneers and consultants) of Kingston, Jamaica. The directors did an assessment of the valuation during the year which determined that the estimated market value of the land and buildings, as at the reporting date, is not materially different from their carrying values.

This fair value was determined using level 3 fair value measurements as the valuation model used both observable and unobservable inputs and the unobservable inputs are considered significant to the fair value measurement [see also note 2(c)(ii)].

24. Segment information

The Group maintains discrete financial information for each of its parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), identified as the Group's Managing Director, as a basis for allocating resources. Each park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation under IFRS 8 due to similar economic characteristics and all of the parks provide similar products and services, share similar processes for delivering services and target the same type and class of customers.

Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors the operations, the Group has concluded that its operating segments should be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment.

Financial information related to the reportable segment results for the year ended December 31, 2022, can be found in the Group income statement and related notes. There are no differences in the measurement of the reportable segment results and the Group's results.

On September 3, 2019, the Government of Jamaica established a defined contribution pension scheme for tourism workers and self-employed tourism workers known as the “Tourism Workers Pension Scheme” in accordance with the Tourism Workers Pension Act 2019. On January 12, 2022, the Pension Scheme was officially launched. The Pension Scheme is administered and managed by the Guardian Group.

During the year, some of the Group’s employees enrolled into the Tourism Workers Pension Scheme. Members are mandated to contribute 3% of their earnings up to January 31, 2023 and 5% of their earnings thereafter. The member’s contributions to the scheme are matched by the employer.

The members have an option to make voluntary contributions to the scheme and the maximum allowable annual contribution is 20% of the earnings for each member.

The Group and the Company’s contributions to the scheme for the year ended December 31, 2022 aggregated $6,210.

26. Commitments and contingencies (continued)

(ii) There are threatened claims against the Company in respect of alleged injuries by guests and employees. The potential liability in the opinion of the Company’s attorney is approximately J$3,900,000 ($26,006) [2021: J$4,100,000 ($26,840)]. Although these are covered with insurance, the Company is still resisting the claims and has not made any provision in these financial statements. Up to the date of approval of the financial statements, there has been no change in the status of these matters.

(iii) During the year, the Jamaica Customs Agency commenced an audit of the Company’s records from January 2021 to April 2022 and claimed in a letter dated November 22, 2022 that incorrect codes were used for clearance of some items. The Company submitted more documents for review and there was a meeting on December 6, 2022 with the Customs Agency on the matter. The audit is still not complete, and the Customs Agency has not notified the Company of a final decision. The Company has not made any provision in these financial statements for this matter.

27. Financial instruments

(a) Financial risk management:

The Group has exposure to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk from its use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of the business. Derivative financial instruments are not used to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.

(i) Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by the carrying amount of each relevant financial asset.

Cash and cash equivalents and investments

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by:

• placing cash resources with substantial counterparties who are believed to have minimal risk of default;

• only investing in liquid securities with credit worthy institutions that are appropriately licensed and regulated; and

• obtaining sufficient collateral as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

(i) Credit risk (continued):

Accumus receivable

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Management has a credit policy in place under which each customer is analysed for credit worthiness prior to being offered credit. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. At the reporting date there were significant concentrations of credit risk in respect of 6 (2021: 5) major customers for the Group and the Company who in respect of trade receivables.

As at December 31, 2022, amounts receivable from these customers aggregated $1,094,926 (2021: $984,937) for the Group and the Company. These represent 66% (2021: 62%) of trade receivables for the Group and 68% (2021: 60%) for the Company.

Expected credit loss assessment for trade receivables

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit loss (ECLs) of trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward looking information.

Loss rates are calculated based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off, current conditions and the economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables.

Due from related parties and parent company

These amounts are currently interest-free with no fixed repayment terms, however some amounts are repayable on demand. The Group assesses each related entity’s ability to pay if payment is demanded, considering future trading activities and other economic conditions. The expected credit losses are calculated on this basis. No impairment allowance was recognised as at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(ii) Market risk:

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices. These arise mainly from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

• Interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

Subject to normal conditions, the Group materially contracts financial liabilities at fixed interest rates for the duration of the term.

Interest-bearing financial assets are primarily represented by amounts due from subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and investments. Interest-bearing financial liabilities are mainly represented by loans, lease liabilities and bank overdrafts.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

An increase or decrease in basis points in interest rates on variable rate instruments at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss for the year by amounts shown below.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021.

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments

The Group does not account for any financial instrument at fair value. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the carrying value of Group’s financial instruments.

• Foreign currency risk:
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Group incurs foreign currency risk primarily on purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the United States dollar ($). The principal foreign currency exposure of the Group is denominated in Jamaica dollars (J$).

Exposure to foreign currency risk arising mainly in respect of J$ denominated balances was as follows:

  <tr>
    <td>US$ equivalent</td>
    <td>(1,158,586)</td>
    <td>(1,563,457)</td>

Exchange rates of the United States dollar to the Jamaican dollar were as follows:

At December 21, 2022: US$1 to J$149.96
At December 31, 2021: US$1 to J$153.06

Sensitivity analysis

Changes in the exchange rates of the United States dollar ($) to the Jamaica dollar (J$) would have the effects described below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Increase/(decrease) in profit or loss for the year</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>The Group and Company</th>

    <td>4% (2021: 8%) strengthening of the US$ against the J$</td>
    <td>46,343</td>

    <td>1% (2021: 2%) weakening of the US$ against the J$</td>
    <td>(11,586)</td>
    <td>(31,269)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021.

27. Financial instruments (continued)

(a) Financial risk management (continued):

(iii) Liquidity risk:

Liquidity risk, also referred to as funding risk, is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at, or close to, its fair value. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash resources, and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. The management of the Group aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by keeping lines of credit available (see note 12).

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including interest payments. The tables show the undiscounted cash flows of non-derivative financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay:

(iv) Capital management:

The Group manages the adequacy of capital by managing the returns on equity and borrowed funds to protect against losses on its business activities so as to be able to generate an adequate level of return for its stockholders.

As a condition of its long term loans, the Company is required to have positive stockholders’ equity.

There are no other externally imposed capital requirements and there have been no changes in the Group’s approach to managing capital during the year.

27. Financial instruments (continued)

(b) Fair value:

The following methods and assumptions have been used:

(i) The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, due from related companies and parent company, is assumed to approximate their carrying value due to their relatively short-term nature.

(ii) The carrying amounts of due from subsidiaries are assumed to approximate their fair value due as the amounts are stated after discounting their future cash flows.

(iii) The carrying value of lease liabilities and long-term loans approximates the fair value as these obligations are carried at amortised cost reflecting their contractual obligations and the interest rates are reflective of market rates for similar instruments.

28. Prior period adjustments

During the year, management discovered that the classification or presentation of some items in the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and cash flows were not in line with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. The nature of the reclassifications are as follows:

(i) Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive:

As required by IAS1.82(ba), movement in ECL is required to be shown separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the prior period, ECL movement on trade receivables was presented as part of 'operating expenses – selling'. Impairment loss reversal in the prior period is now reclassified and presented separately from selling expenses.

(ii) Statement of cash flows:

IAS 7 requires an entity applying IFRS to present its cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in a manner which is most appropriate to its business. The reclassifications resulted in changes in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. The adjustments are as follows for the Group and the Company:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Due from related parties (i)</td>
    <td>249,784</td>

28. Prior period adjustments (continued)

(ii) Statement of cash flows (continued):

(i) Due from related parties, in the corresponding figures, was reclassified from investing activities to operating activities as the balance resulted from ordinary trading activities.

(ii) Lease payments were understated with the corresponding amount shown as 'Rent concession'. The amount was adjusted accordingly.

(iii) Bank overdraft was previously presented as a component of cash and cash equivalents. As this overdraft was not deemed to form an integral part of the Group and Company's cash management, overdraft is included in financing activities – split between inflows and outflows.

These reclassifications apply for both the Group and the Company.

The impact of the reclassifications on the financial statements are as follows:

(i) Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (2021):
