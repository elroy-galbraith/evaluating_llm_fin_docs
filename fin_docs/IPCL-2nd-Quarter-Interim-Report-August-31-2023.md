Directors’ Report

The Board of Directors of Image Plus Consultants Limited (the Company) is pleased to present the Company’s unaudited financial statements for the second quarter ended August 31, 2023. The statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial highlights are as follows:

    <th>For the 6 month period ended August 31 2023</th>

Revenues & Expenses

Revenues for the six months to August 2023 was flat at $554M when compared to the similar period in 2022. For the second quarter, revenues declined by 26% to $39M when compared to second quarter in the prior year. The performance was impacted by the following factors;
1. Scan volumes for the six-months period to August 31, 2023 was 28,729 cases when compared to 27,707 cases for the same period in prior year, representing growth of 4%.
2. Growth was recorded in the modalities of x-ray and fluoroscopy cases. The Company is pleased to report that Mammography scans at the Ocho Rios and Molyneus Road locations started in the month of August 2023 with the installation of the new mammography machines; 229 mammogram cases were completed between installation and the end of Q2.
3. During the second quarter of FY2024, there was a reduction in the CT modality case count (which accounts for a higher per patient revenue compared to other modalities) due to machine downtime with the units at 129Pro and Winchester locations. Machine downtime is a part of the reality for the imaging industry and we continue to proactively manage this issue by ensuring timely servicing of all imaging machines. The CT machine at the Winchester location was brought back into service relatively quickly, however the CT at the 129Pro location was out of service for an extended period due to the nature of the problem. To compensate for machine downtime of the CT at our 129Pro location, our operating hours at the Winchester location were extended to re-direct some of the demand of our referring physicians and reduce the impact on scan count and revenues. Again, this highlights the benefit of having multiple modalities at all our locations. In the case of the 129Pro unit, technical experts from the manufacturer, General Electric (GE), were engaged and with their guidance and ensuing multiple part replacements, the unit has been tested for functionality, requiring only one final part to return to normal operations. That part is en route to Jamaica.

Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in our scan count across all modalities and improved revenue performance in keeping with our first quarter trajectory. Mammograms are being offered on a daily basis at both our Ocho Rios and Molynes Road branches. The response has been very encouraging and we anticipate significant case-count performance from this new modality, especially with breast cancer screening awareness promotions planned for October 2023.

With the composite flat revenue and direct costs increasing by 5%, the gross profit margin declined to 63.8% vs 65.6% recorded in the prior year. The administrative expense margin for the six months to August 2023 stood at 47.2% vs 36.7% over the prior period. The growth in administrative expenses was due largely to:
• 25% increase in depreciation due to acquisition of imaging equipment and increase in right of use of asset associated with leases for our locations,
• 155% increase in professional fees associated with being a listed entity
• 26% increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from increased staff count, inflationary adjustments for the year, overtime and other expenses.

It is important to note that these expense increases are in keeping with continued business growth through the offering of new modalities. To proactively manage our performance, expense savings were registered in costs associated with advertising, repairs and maintenance, office supplies and utilities. For the second half of the year management is laser-focused on ensuring improved revenue performance and cost containment to compensate for the fall off in Q2 profitability. Our profitability ratios remain one of the key performance indicators for both management and the board.

At J$39M the Net Profit for Q2 FY2024 and the six month YTD Net profit of J$103M reflects a reduction of $13.4M and J$22.1M respectively over the prior periods, due to the aforementioned factors.

Balance Sheet

At the end of the first six months of FY2024, assets stood at J$1.24B when compared to J$619.4M for the corresponding period in the prior year. This growth was due primarily to increases in;
1. Property, plant and equipment as a result of acquisition of new imaging equipment and outfitting of our Ocho Rios location,
2. Right of Use Asset associated with the lease of our Ocho Rios location
3. Trade and other receivables.
   a. Trade receivables stand at J$235.7M as a result of continued growth in patient scan volumes. The majority of the trade receivables balance is from one large payor who continues to settle on a consistent basis and from whom we have both written commitments and detailed payment timelines to consistently reduce their outstanding amount. This amount has since been reduced in Q3 to date and is believed to be fully collectible based on the historical experience with the payor.
   b. Other receivables include J$373M for deposits on imaging equipment and land purchased to develop our new location.

Total Liabilities grew by $14.3M during the six months to August 2023 due to borrowings used to finance acquisition of equipment and an increase in lease liability associated with our Right-of-Use asset. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in trade payables and income tax payable during the period.

Total equity for the six months to August 2023 grew by J$604.7M to J$966.4M. This was due to the increase in our share capital of $465M from the IPO and a growth of J$139.9M in retained earnings.

Outlook for New Financial Year

The purchase of land for our soon-to-be flagship location is in its final stages and the transaction is estimated to close in Q3 FY 2024. Regarding the new modalities, mammography services have been launched, and though delayed by a month our MRI unit has been shipped from the manufacturer and is anticipated to be in place and operational by Q4 of the financial year. We use this opportunity to thank every member of the team for their efforts and as always to acknowledge, with gratitude, the ongoing trust and confidence placed in us by our referring physicians, their patients and our shareholders.
