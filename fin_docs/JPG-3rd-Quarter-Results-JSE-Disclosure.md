CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

The performance of Jamaica Producers Group (“JP” or the “Group”) for the 39-week period ended October 2, 2021 was strong. JP increased year-to-date revenues by 21% relative to the prior year and surpassed the 2019 revenues by 17%. For the 13-week period ended October 2, 2021 (the “Third Quarter”), the Group increased revenues by 24% relative to the 2020 Third Quarter and by 26% relative to the 2019 Third Quarter. The revenue performance of the Group in 2020 was adversely impacted by the disruption to business activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our markets continued to experience limitations or “lockdowns” on some economic activity during 2021, particularly during the 2021 Third Quarter. The revenue growth that we experienced across the Group demonstrates the quality and stewardship of our product and service lines and the resilience of our diverse portfolio of interests.

JP generated consolidated year-to-date profits of $2.3 billion and consolidated profits for the Third Quarter of $938 million. The 2021 year-to-date profit attributable to shareholders was $1.1 billion and $454 million for the 2021 Third Quarter. In the 2020 Third Quarter, JP reported a one-off gain on the sale of shares of $1.5 billion. After excluding this one-off gain, Third Quarter and year-to-date profits increased significantly on the back of improved revenues and strengthened gross margins. Year-to-date shareholder profits increased 3-fold relative to the 2020 result (after excluding the one-off gain).

JP Logistics & Infrastructure

The Logistics and Infrastructure Division (the “L&I Division”) accounts for the major share of the Group’s net assets and, in turn, its profits. In addition to Kingston Wharves Limited, the Division’s largest subsidiary (which operates a multipurpose port and logistics hub), the L&I Division also includes JP Shipping Services Limited (which operates logistics and freight forwarding services between Caribbean ports and the United Kingdom). With effect from April of this year, the results for the L&I Division also reflect the Group’s 50% joint venture interest in Geest Line Limited (“Geest”), our shipping line operating between Europe and the Caribbean. Geest specializes in the transportation of refrigerated cargo to Europe and the movement of general cargo and vehicles to the Caribbean. The L&I Division generated 2021 year-to-date profit before finance cost and taxation of $2.8 billion from revenues of $7.2 billion. Divisional profits before finance cost and taxation are up 34% relative to the comparable period in 2020.

JP Food & Drink

JP’s Food and Drink Division (the “F&D Division”) is the largest contributor to the revenues of the Group. The Division earned year-to-date revenues of $10.8 billion, an increase of 19% relative to the first nine months of the prior year. Profits before finance cost and taxation for the F&D Division were $376 million, compared to $121 million in the prior year. The F&D Division comprises our portfolio of subsidiaries that are engaged in farming, food processing, distribution and retail of food and drink, and includes production facilities in Europe and the Caribbean and a distribution centre in the United States. A.L. Hoogesteger Fresh Specialist B.V. (“Hoogesteger”) is the largest contributor to the revenues and profits of the Division. This business is a market leader in fresh juice in Northern Europe and serves as a co-packer of juice for major supermarket and food service entities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavia, Switzerland and Italy. During the Third Quarter, JP acquired a 50% joint venture interest in Co Beverage Lab S.L. (“CoBeverage”), an emerging fresh juice manufacturer operating in Spain. This acquisition allows the Group to deploy its expertise in vegetable and fruit juice extraction and bottling to the development of business opportunities in Southern Europe.

Our range of specialty food and drink interests also include tropical snacks (JP Snacks), fresh fruit (JP Farms) and baked goods, infused with spirits (Tortuga International).

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT CONT'D

Outlook

The current economic environment is affected by the pandemic (and the restrictions placed on consumer activity), inflation and disruptions to global trade and supply chains. Our success in the Third Quarter and for the year-to date was achieved despite these constraints. This gives us confidence in our decision to acquire, build and operate a diverse portfolio of Food & Drink and Logistics & Infrastructure businesses in Europe and the Caribbean, as well as in related markets in North America. Importantly, we have done this while building a strong balance sheet, maintaining a high degree of liquidity and installing strong governance and financial controls. As at the end of the Third Quarter, our consolidated holdings of cash and marketable securities stood at $10.6 billion.

It is in this context that our board and management have decided to manage through the challenges of COVID-19 while, at the same time adopting a decisively opportunistic and aggressive growth posture. In each of our core market segments we have sought to identify and secure bold new platforms for long-term growth.

During the 2021 Second Quarter, we acquired our joint venture interest in Geest. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Geest plays an important role in trade (particularly in fresh fruit) between Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Europe and the Eastern Caribbean. Through Kingston Wharves and JP Shipping Services, we have long participated in key aspects of Caribbean logistics. Geest offers an additional dimension to this activity.

During the 2021 Third Quarter, we acquired our joint venture interest in CoBeverage. This fresh juice manufacturer will allow us to utilise our market leading expertise in the manufacturing of fresh fruit and vegetable juice in a major new market with significant growth potential. We also benefit from our partnership with major Southern European interests in the production and sale of chilled food in Europe.

Subsequent to the end of the Third Quarter, we acquired a 50% interest in Grupo Alaska, S.A. This ice and bottled water business – based in the Dominican Republic –operates at the heart of the largest and fastest growing consumer market in the Caribbean. Along with our joint-venture partner, we are convinced that this market presents a major prospect for long-term regional growth in consumer goods and services. Our Tortuga International and JP Snacks businesses already have a strong engagement with the Caribbean consumer, and we are excited to have this additional platform.

I thank our board, management and team members globally for their commitment to our business and our shared values. I thank our customers and partners for their continued support.

JAMAICA PRODUCERS GROUP LIMITED
UNAUDITED GROUP RESULTS
39 WEEKS ENDED OCTOBER 2, 2021

Notes to the Financial Statements

1. Group’s Operations and Activities

Jamaica Producers Group Limited (“company”) is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The company’s registered office is located at 4 Fourth Avenue, Newport West, Kingston 13.

The main activities of the company and its subsidiaries (“group”), and associates are port terminal operations, logistics, food and juice manufacturing, the cultivation, marketing and distribution of fresh produce, land management and the holding of investments.

During the current year, on April 9, 2021, the group acquired a 50% shareholding in Geest Line Limited (“Geest”). Geest, based in the UK, is the leading shipping line connecting Europe and the Caribbean. Geest is treated as a Joint Venture in the consolidated financial statements of the group and accounted for under the equity method of consolidation.

On September 1, 2021, the group acquired a 50% shareholding in Co Beverage Lab S.L. (“CBL”). CBL is a producer of fruit and vegetable juices based in Barcelona, Spain and with sales across Europe. CBL is treated as an Associate in the consolidated financial statements of the group and accounted for under the equity method of consolidation.

Subsequent to the quarter end, on October 16, 2021, the group completed an investment in Grupo Frontera Limited (“GFL”), a joint venture holding company. JP owns 50% of the issued shares in GFL. On the same date, a subsidiary of GFL completed the acquisition of the operations and assets of Grupo Alaska, a leading ice and bottled water producer and distributor in the Dominican Republic. GFL is treated as a Joint Venture in the consolidated financial statements of the group and accounted for under the equity method of consolidation. As the acquisition occurred subsequent to the end of the quarter the results of GFL have not been included in these quarterly financial statements.

On August 13, 2020, the group concluded an agreement to sell part of its interest in SAJE Logistics Infrastructure Limited (“SAJE”), representing 22.1% of the issued share capital of SAJE, for consideration of $1.9 billion, resulting in a gain of $1.87 billion before transaction costs. The group retains an investment representing 9.6% of the issued share capital of SAJE through Kingston Wharves Limited, and accounts for this remaining investment on the basis of fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”).

2. Basis of Presentation

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

The accounting policies and methods of computation used in these financial statements are consistent with the most recent annual report except where certain new, revised and amended standards and interpretations came into effect during the current financial year.

3. Gross operating revenue

Gross operating revenue comprises investment income, the gross sales of goods and services of the group and commission earned by the group on consignment sales. This is shown after deducting returns, rebates, discounts and consumption taxes and eliminating sales within the group.

4. Profit per stock unit and stockholders’ equity per stock unit

Profit per ordinary stock unit is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the group for the quarter of $454,288,000 by 1,122,144,036, being the total number of ordinary stock units in issue during the quarter and a weighted average number of ordinary stock units in issue (excluding those held by the ESOP) during the quarter. The weighted average number of ordinary stock units in issue (excluding those held by the ESOP) for the quarter ended October 2, 2021 was 1,046,865,148 (2020 - 1,046,865,148) stock units.

Stockholders’ equity per ordinary stock unit is calculated by dividing the parent company stockholders’ equity by 1,122,144,036 being the total number of ordinary stock units in issue at the end of the quarter and 1,046,865,148 (2020 – 1,046,865,148), representing the total number of ordinary stock units in issue for the quarter ended October 2, 2021 less those held by the ESOP at the same date.

5. Accounting Policies

The following accounting policies have been reflected in these financial statements in compliance with IFRS:

a. Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

b. Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the group. The group controls an investee when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.

The company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “group”.

c. Associates and Joint Ventures
Associates are those entities over which the group has significant influence, but not control, or joint control over the financial and operating polices, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the group has joint control, whereby the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to it’s assets and obligation for it’s liabilities.

5. Accounting Policies (cont’d)

Associates and joint ventures (cont’d)
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost, including transaction costs.

The group’s investment is carried at the group’s share of the fair value of net identifiable assets of the associate or joint venture net of any impairment loss identified on acquisition. The group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the profit and loss account and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that the profits, losses or movements are consistent with the group’s significant accounting policies. Should the group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equal or exceed its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the group will not recognize further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

d. Intangible assets and goodwill

(i) Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is including in the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee as a whole.

(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.

(iii) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

(iv) Amortisation
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over their estimated useful lives, from the date that they are available for use.

The estimates of useful lives are as follows:
• brands and trademarks                25 years
• customer relationships              10 - 15 years
• other identified intangible assets   3 - 5 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

e. Segment reporting

Segment information is presented in respect of the group’s strategic business segments. The identification of business segments is based on the group’s management and internal reporting structure. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The group’s business segments reflect its current strategy and focus. The profit or loss before finance cost and taxation is used to measure the segment result. This has resulted in the recognition of three business segments:

▪ JP Food & Drink - This comprises businesses that are engaged in agriculture, processing, distribution and/or retail of food and drink.

▪ JP Logistics & Infrastructure - This comprises businesses that are engaged in logistics, transportation, port operations and related industries.

▪ Corporate Services - This comprises interest and investment income, net of the cost of corporate functions not directly charged to business units.

9. COVID-19

The coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt global trade and commercial activity. The Group is continuously monitoring the impact of this disruption and the associated economic downturn on its financial position, financial results, and cash flows. During the quarter there was no material deterioration of the Group’s net current asset position and the Group maintains a favourable liquidity position with strong levels of cash and short-term deposit balances.

The group continues to actively monitor and manage the associated risks of COVID-19 through its Board of Directors and management teams as it maintains safety measures to minimise the impact on operations, staff, customers and other stakeholders while ensuring the ongoing financial health of the Group.
