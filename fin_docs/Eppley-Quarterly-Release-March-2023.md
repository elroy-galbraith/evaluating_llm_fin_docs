Dividend Declared $0.052/share
Stockholders’ Equity $954 million
Investment Portfolio $5.1 billion
Interest Income $108 million

Eppley is a growing, diverse Caribbean investment company that has a track record of producing high and consistent returns for our shareholders.

Our investment strategy is focused on private markets in credit, mezzanine, real estate and infrastructure.

Subsequent Event
The Group successfully closed a tender offer to acquire 45.04% cellular shares of Eppley Caribbean Property Fund Limited SCC- Development Fund in April 2023. The Group expects to recognize a gain on bargain purchase of approximately $220 million in the second quarter.

Letter to Shareholders

May 12, 2023

Fellow Shareholders,

Eppley produced earnings per share of $0.35 in the first quarter of 2023, an 11% return for shareholders.¹

Proprietary Investment Portfolio
At the end of March 2023, we owned a $5.1 billion investment portfolio consisting of cash, loans, leases, receivables and investments in our mezzanine, real estate, infrastructure and asset management joint ventures and subsidiaries. The average income yield of our portfolio was 14% and 16% excluding our cash balances.

Asset Management Business
In addition to our proprietary portfolio, we also manage or administer the equivalent of over US$120 million of capital primarily through the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund, Caribbean Mezzanine Fund and Capital Infrastructure Group.

Capitalization and Liquidity
Our leverage was 4.2x our capital at the end of the first quarter and our average cost of debt was 6%. We closed the quarter with $747 million of cash.

Financial Performance
Our profit after tax for the first three months of 2023 was $67 million when compared against $92 million generated for the first quarter of last year.

The financial performance this quarter was affected by two timing related impacts.

Firstly, last year we received approximately $19 million in dividends from our investment in NorthStar in the first quarter. This year we expect to receive that dividend in the second quarter.

¹ Based on a cost basis of $3.21 per share which assumes an investor subscribed in the IPO and fully participated in our rights issue.

Letter to Shareholders (Cont’d)

Secondly, our first quarter results do not reflect the impact of the tender for 45.04% of the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund-Development Fund shares as the effective date of the transaction was on April 11, 2023 or just shortly after the end of the quarter. We expect the transaction to result in a gain on bargain of approximately $220 million which will be reflected in the second quarter.

Had these two items been reflected in the first quarter our net profit after tax for the first quarter would have been over $300 million or more than our earnings in all of 2022.

We are pleased to advise that our wholly owned subsidiary, Eppley Consumer Finance Limited, has now been granted approval by the Bank of Jamaica to operate as a Microcredit Institution which should lead to increased activity.

Dividend
Today the Board of Directors approved a dividend of 5.2 cents per share payable on June 12, 2023, to ordinary shareholders on record as of May 29, 2023.

Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, we expect to maintain our dividend policy in future periods.

Outlook
The outlook for the remainder of the year is positive as the impact of the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund – Development Fund tender offer and a number of large lease opportunities should be reflected beginning in the second quarter.

Sincerely,

P.B Scott
Chairman

Nicholas A. Scott
Vice Chairman
