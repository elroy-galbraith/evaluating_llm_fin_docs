The Group's total revenue in Q2 reached US$4.4 million, representing a 5% increase year-over-year, and a 12% surge from the pre-Covid revenue of Q2 2019. The increase in revenue compared to previous year, was a result of a higher number of guests visiting our parks coupled with a 6% greater revenue per visitor.

The number of stopover visitors to Jamaica during this quarter remained stable compared to pre-pandemic times, on the other hand, the cruise line industry continued showing a strong performance providing Dolphin Cove with meaningful sales growth. Although the increase in park visitors during the first half of the year can be partly attributed to the pandemic's effects in the first part of 2022, it is worth noting that the number of guests was 15% higher than in the same period of 2019.

The good performance in the top line, the proficiency in the administration of resources and the strategic capital investments led the Company to achieve a remarkable after-tax profit of US$1.2 million in Q2, 20% greater than Q2 2022. For the six-month period ended June 2023 the profit after tax was US$2.7 million a 50% greater year-over-year and 58% or US$1 million more compared to the same period in 2019.

Dolphin Cove's financial position remains strong, with a substantial amount of available liquidity and operational cash flow generation. As at June, working capital increased by US$1.5 million, representing an 47% surge from Q2 2022 and US$1.6 million increase from December 2022.

During the first six months of the year, we generated US$2.2 million of cash through operating activities. This enabled us to accommodate a US$1 million dividend payout and to invest in upgrading our facilities, refreshing our motor vehicle fleet, and launching our latest attraction, the "Fly High" five-station zip line. These strategic investments are poised to elevate our performance and drive growth for the Company.

Update on GCT Assessment

In regards to the GCT assessment referred to in Note 26 (b)(i) of the audited financial statements for the year ended December 2022, Dolphin Cove released a notice to its shareholders in May 18 to inform de decision of the Revenue Appeals Division to confirm the Assessment for J$91,797,671 exclusive of any interests or penalties.

After discussions held with our Counsel, Dolphin Cove has decided to take this case to the Court and continue with the appeal process in this new instance, as of the date of this report there has been no further developments on this matter.

7.- Asset revaluations.
Fair value of land and buildings
Land and buildings are revalued periodically to fair market value, and the last valuation done was in April 2020. These valuations are conducted by independent professional valuers, using recent selling prices of comparable properties.

However, as no two properties are exactly alike, adjustments are made to reflect differences between properties. Consequently, the determination of fair market value of the property requires that the valuers analyze the differences in relation to age and physical condition, time of sale, land to building ratio, the advantages and disadvantages of the location and other functional gains to be derived from the property, and make necessary adjustments.

Fair value of dolphins
All dolphins are carried at fair value. The fair values are determined based on the market price of dolphins similar age and recent transactions relating to the purchase and sale of dolphins within the wider group.
