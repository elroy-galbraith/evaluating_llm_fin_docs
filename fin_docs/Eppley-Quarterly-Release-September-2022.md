Fellow Shareholders,

Eppley produced earnings per share of $0.97 in the first nine months of 2022, generating a 30% return for shareholders.¹

Proprietary Investment Portfolio
At the end of September 2022, we owned a $5.3 billion investment portfolio consisting of cash, loans, leases, receivables and investments in our mezzanine, real estate, infrastructure and asset management joint ventures and subsidiaries. The average income yield of our portfolio was 14% and 16% excluding our cash balances.

Asset Management Business
Through the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund, Caribbean Mezzanine Fund and other vehicles, we also manage or administer the equivalent of over US$100 million of capital in addition to our proprietary portfolio.

Capitalization and Liquidity
Our leverage was 3.9x our capital at the end of the third quarter and our average cost of debt was 6%. We closed the quarter with $904 million of cash.

Financial Performance
Our profit after tax for the first nine months of 2022 was $187 million when compared against $191 million generated for the comparable period of last year.

Eppley’s performance over the last three quarters did not reflect any benefits from foreign exchange gains as was the case in the prior year.

¹ Based on a cost basis of $3.21 per share which assumes an investor subscribed in the IPO and fully participated in our rights issue.

Our investment in the Cross Roads property increased by $3 million based on a recent independent valuation. Last year, our share of profit in this joint venture increased in value by $22 million.

Eppley’s core net interest income remains strong, growing by 36% over the $82 million generated for the period ended September 2021. This growth was driven by the leasing portfolio which will continue to be the major source of activity in the proprietary portfolio.

Our quality of earnings remains healthy and is supported by a consistent, recurring revenue stream derived from managing or administering assets across our real estate, mezzanine and infrastructure strategies.

Dividend
Today the Board of Directors approved a dividend of 5.2 cents per share payable on December 15, 2022, to ordinary shareholders on record as of November 30, 2022.

Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, we expect to maintain our dividend policy in future periods.

Outlook
The outlook for the next few quarters remains positive and the team will remain focused on scaling the business and leveraging its origination capabilities to deploy cash on attractive terms.

We remain well positioned to handle tightening credit conditions and will continue to focus on expanding our asset management business.

Sincerely,

P.B. Scott
Chairman

Nicholas A. Scott
Vice Chairman
