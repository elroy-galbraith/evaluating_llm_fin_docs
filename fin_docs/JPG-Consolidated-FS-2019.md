INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
JAMAICA PRODUCERS GROUP LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jamaica Producers Group Limited (the company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “the group”), set out on pages 8 to 64, which comprise the group balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, the group profit and loss account, statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group as at December 31, 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

1 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets

    <th>The key audit matter</th>
    <th>How the matter was addressed in our audit</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The carrying value of the group’s goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable due to changes in the business and economic environment in which specific subsidiaries operate. These factors create inherent uncertainty in forecasting and require significant judgement in estimating and discounting future cash flows that support the assessment of recoverability.<br><i>See Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.</i></td>
    <td>Our audit procedures included testing the reasonableness of the group’s forecasts and discounted cash flow calculations, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Using our own valuation specialists to evaluate the assumptions and methodologies used by management.</li>
        <li>Comparing the group's assumptions to externally derived data as well as our own assessments of key inputs, such as projected economic growth, competition, cost inflation and discount rates, as well as performing sensitivity analysis on the assumptions.</li>
        <li>Assessing the adequacy of the group's disclosures about the assumptions and the sensitivity of the impairment assessments to changes in key assumptions.</li>

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the company’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2019, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the Appendix to this auditors’ report. This description, which is located at pages 6 to 7, forms part of our auditors’ report.

Report on Additional Matters as Required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit. In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act, in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Nigel Chambers.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
JAMAICA PRODUCERS GROUP LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ Report (continued)

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matters or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

JAMAICA PRODUCERS GROUP LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements
Year ended December 31, 2019

1. The company

Jamaica Producers Group Limited ("the company") is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The company’s registered office is located at 4 Fourth Avenue, Newport West, Kingston 13.

The main activities of the company, its subsidiaries (collectively, “group”) and associates (note 33) are port terminal operations; logistics; the cultivation, marketing and distribution of fresh produce; food and juice manufacturing; land management and the holding of investments.

On April 29, 2019, the group sold 30% of the shares of its subsidiary JP Snacks Caribbean Limited for consideration totalling $585.4 million. This did not result in a loss of control of the subsidiary. JP Snacks Caribbean Limited manufactures, markets and sells tropical snacks under the St Mary’s brand.

On November 1, 2019, the group, through its subsidiary, KW Logistics Limited, acquired control of SSL REIT Limited, formerly a joint venture interest, through the acquisition of the remaining 50% shareholding for $64.4 million. The primary business of SSL REIT Limited (renamed KW Warehousing Services Limited) is in the rental of warehousing facilities.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

This is the first set of the group’s annual financial statements in which IFRS 16, Leases has been applied. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 3.

Standards issued but not yet effective

At the date of authorisation of the financial statements, certain new and amended standards have been issued which are not yet effective and which the group has not early-adopted. The group has assessed the relevance of all such new standards and amendments with respect to its operations and has determined that the following may be relevant:

• Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and provides the following definition of ‘material’ to guide preparers of financial statements in making judgements about information to be included in financial statements.

    “Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.”

The group is assessing the impact that the amendment will have on its 2020 financial statements.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation (continued)

(a) Statement of compliance (continued)

Standards issued but not yet effective (continued)

• Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020. The revised framework covers all aspects of standard-setting including the objective of financial reporting. The main change relates to how and when assets and liabilities are recognised and derecognised in the financial statements:

- New ‘bundle of rights’ approach to assets will mean that an entity may recognise a right to use an asset rather than the asset itself;
- A liability will be recognised if a company has no practical ability to avoid it. This may bring liabilities on-balance-sheet earlier than at present.
- A new control-based approach to de-recognition will allow an entity to derecognise an asset when it loses control over all or part of it; the focus will no longer be on the transfer of risks and rewards.

The group is assessing the impact that the amendments will have on its 2020 financial statements.

(b) Basis of preparation

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for available-for-sale investments which are measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in Jamaica dollars (J$), which is the functional currency of the company.

(c) Use of estimates and judgment

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of, and disclosures relating to assets, liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the reporting date and the income and expenses for the year then ended. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods. Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are discussed below:

*End of Page 16*

### Page 17

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation (continued)

(c) Use of estimates and judgment (continued)

    (i) Impairment losses on trade receivables

    Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss ("ECL") on the trade accounts receivable.

    Under the ECL model, the group analyses its accounts receivable in a matrix by days past due and determines for each age bracket an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 8 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable.

    The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the applicable ageing bracket.

    (ii) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

    Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is dependent upon management’s internal assessment of future cash flows from the intangibles and cash-generating units that gave rise to the goodwill. That internal assessment determines the amount recoverable from future use of cash generating units in respect of goodwill. The estimate of the amount recoverable from future use of those cash generating units is sensitive to the discount rates used (note 14).

    (iii) Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values

    Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values rely on judgment and estimates by management, one of which is that the relevant assets will continue to be used for their current purpose within the group. In addition, useful lives and residual values vary between individual assets and are dependent upon continuation of the current level of maintenance. Should there be a change in the present use or level of maintenance this could change the charge for depreciation and net book value of property, plant and equipment (note 16) within the next financial year.

3. Changes in accounting policies

The group initially applied IFRS 16 Leases from January 1, 2019. A number of other new standards are also effective from January 1, 2019 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

The group applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised at January 1, 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 is not restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.

The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed in note 4(o). Additionally, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 16 have not generally been applied to comparative information.

*End of Page 17*

---

### Page 18

3. Changes in accounting policies (continued)

(a) The group used a number of practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. In particular, the group:
   – did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application;
   – did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases of low value assets (e.g. IT equipment);
   – excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and
   – used hindsight when determining the lease term.

(b) Impact on transition

   (i) On transition to IFRS 16, the group recognised additional right-of-use assets, including investment property, and additional lease liabilities, recognising the difference in retained earnings. The impact on transition is summarised below:

      $'000
      Right-of-use assets – property, plant and equipment        716,002
      Lease liabilities                                         (716,002)
      ======

   (ii) In measuring lease liabilities at January 1, 2019, the group discounted lease payments using incremental borrowing rates appropriate to each of its operations.

      $'000
      Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2018 as disclosed under IAS 17 in the group’s financial statements                217,909
      Discounted using the weighted incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019                        6.7%
      Lease liabilities recognised at January 1, 2019                                                        (716,002)

4. Significant accounting policies

Except for the changes described in note 3, the group has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out hereafter to all periods presented in these financial statements.

(a) Basis of consolidation

   (i) Business combinations

      Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the date on which control is transferred to the group. Control is the power to govern the relevant financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

*End of Page 18*

---

### Page 19

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of consolidation (continued)

    (i) Business combinations (continued)

    The group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
        • the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
        • the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired entity; plus
        • if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing interest in the acquired entity; less
        • the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

    When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

    The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts generally are recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.

    Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.

    (ii) Non-controlling interests

    Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets from the acquisition date.

    Changes in the group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the change in the carrying value of non-controlling interest and the fair value of consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.

    (iii) Subsidiaries

    Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the group. The group controls an investee when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.

    The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries, including an Employees Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) classified as a structured entity (note 20), made up to December 31, 2019.

*End of Page 19*

---

### Page 20

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of consolidation (continued)

(iv) Loss of control

On the loss of control, the group derecognises the assets and liabilities, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the group retains any interest in a former subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.

(v) Joint venture arrangements

A joint venture is a contractual arrangement in which the group has joint control and whereby the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint ventures are recognised initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of joint ventures using the equity method, until the date on which joint control ceases. If the group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture the group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of a joint venture. If the joint venture subsequently reports gains, the group resumes recognising its share of those gains only after its share of gains equals the share of losses not recognised.

(vi) Associates

Associates are those entities over which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control over the financial and operating polices, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs.

The group’s investment is carried at its share of the fair value of net identifiable assets of the associate net of any impairment loss identified on acquisition.

The group’s share of associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the profits, losses or movements are consistent with the group’s significant accounting policies.

Should the group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group will not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(a) Basis of consolidation (continued)

(vii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Balances and transactions between companies within the group, and any unrealised gains arising from those transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions between the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transactions provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

(b) Foreign currencies

The group's foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the buying rates of exchange ruling at the reporting date [note 32(b)(ii)]. Items in the foreign subsidiaries' profit and loss accounts are translated at rates of £1 to J$166.85 (2018: J$169.93), US$1 to J132.63 (2018: J$128.04), €1 to J$144.83 (2018: J$146.67), being the weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Other transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the rates of exchange at the dates of those transactions.

Gains and losses arising from translating profit or loss items are included in profit or loss. Unrealised portions of such gains are ultimately transferred to capital reserve. Exchange differences arising on other changes to stockholders' interests are reflected in other capital reserves [note 20(ii)].

(c) Financial instruments – Classification, recognition and de-recognition, and measurement

Financial instruments carried on the statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments, securities purchased under resale agreement, investments, payables and loans and borrowing.

Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets that are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss and: a) are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and b) have contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are classified as “Held to collect” and measured at amortised cost.

Amortised cost represents the net present value ("NPV") of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:

• Cash and cash equivalents;
• Accounts receivable;
• Short-term investments; and
• Securities purchased under resale agreements.

*End of Page 21*

---

### Page 22

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(c) Financial instruments – Classification, recognition and de-recognition, and measurement (continued)

Due to their short-term nature, the group initially recognises these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses.

Equity instruments

On initial recognition of an equity instrument, the group elects to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. Subsequent changes in the investment at fair value are recorded in OCI.

Subsequent measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in their individual policy notes.

Impairment of financial assets

For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which allows the use of a lifetime expected loss provision. The lifetime ECLs are determined by taking into consideration historical rates of default for each segment of aged receivables as well as the estimated impact of forward looking information.

The group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on other financial assets that are measured at amortised cost. At each reporting date, the loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. If at the reporting date, the credit risk on the financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured for the financial asset at an amount equal to twelve month expected credit losses [see note 3a)].

Macroeconomic Factors, Forward Looking Information and Multiple Scenarios

The group applies an unbiased and probability weighted estimate of credit losses by evaluating a range of possible outcomes that incorporates forecasts of future economic conditions. Macroeconomic factors and forward-looking information are incorporated into the measurement of ECL as well as the determination of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting date reflect reasonable and supportable information at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The group uses three scenarios that are probability weighted to determine ECL.

Derecognition

A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement, and either (a) the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

*End of Page 22*

---

### Page 23

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(c) Financial instruments – Classification, recognition and de-recognition, and measurement (continued)

Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. The group’s financial liabilities, which include accounts payable, are recognised initially at fair value.

Subsequent measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in their individual policy notes.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the group balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

(d) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash comprises cash in hand, on demand and on call deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, rather than for investment or other purposes.

(e) Short-term investments

Short-term investments comprise fixed deposits with banks, money market securities and loans and receivables maturing within one year. They are acquired for their earnings potential and for balancing the group’s risks on its investment portfolio. Their nature, liquidity and risk are similar to those of cash and cash equivalents.

*End of Page 23*

---

### Page 24

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(f) Securities purchased under resale agreements

Securities purchased under resale agreements ('reverse repos') are short-term transactions in which the purchaser makes funds available to other parties and in turn receives securities which it agrees to resell on a specified date at a specified price. Reverse repos are accounted for as short-term collateralised lending.

The difference between the sale and repurchase consideration is recognised on the effective interest basis over the period of the repurchase agreement and is included in interest income.

(g) Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost, determined principally on the first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

(h) Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables, including provisions, are measured at amortised cost. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(i) Biological assets

Biological assets represent the cost of, primarily, pineapple and banana plants which are capitalised up to maturity. These are measured at cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The costs are normally amortised over a period of two years for pineapples and seven years for bananas.

(j) Intangible assets and goodwill

(i) Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (note 14) and tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee as a whole.

(ii) Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

(iii) Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

*End of Page 24*

---

### Page 25

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(j) Intangible assets and goodwill (continued)

(iv) Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on the straight-line basis in profit or loss over their estimated useful lives from the date that they are available for their intended use by management. Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• brands and trademarks 25 years
• customer relationships 10-15 years
• other identified intangible assets 3-5 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as appropriate.

(k) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Owned assets

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the costs of material and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the present value of costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. Borrowing costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are recognised as part of the cost of the qualifying asset.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

(ii) Subsequent costs

The group recognises the cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment in the carrying amount of such an item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

(iii) Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment, including leased assets, with the exception of freehold land, on which no depreciation is charged, are depreciated on the straight-line basis at annual rates, varying between 2% and 50%, estimated to write down the assets to residual values over their expected useful lives.

*End of Page 25*

---

### Page 26

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(k) Property, plant and equipment (continued)

(iii) Depreciation (continued)

Computer software and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line basis at rates between 25% and 50% per annum. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date.

(l) Investment property

Investment properties, principally freehold warehouse buildings, are held for long-term rental yields and are not occupied by the Group. Investment property is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Subsequent costs are included in the carrying amount of the asset or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. On replacement of a separately measured part of an item of investment property, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income when the expenditure is incurred.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line balance basis at annual rates to write off the relevant assets over their expected useful lives as follows:

Building        2.5%

Land is not depreciated.

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each statement of financial position date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount [note 4(m)].

Gains and losses on disposal of investment property are determined by comparing proceeds with their carrying amounts and are included in the statement of comprehensive income.

(m) Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the group’s non-financial asset are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of goodwill is estimated at each reporting date.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.

*End of Page 26*

---

### Page 27

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(m) Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(n) Loans payable

Loans payable are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

(o) Leases

Policy applicable from January 1, 2019

At inception of a contract, the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

This policy is applied to contracts entered into, on or after January 1, 2019.

i. As a lessee

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

The group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

(o) Leases (continued)

Policy applicable from January 1, 2019

i. As a lessee (continued)

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the scheduled lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

– fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
– variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
– amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
– the exercise price under a purchase option that the group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group is reasonably certain to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

(o) Leases (continued)

Policy applicable from January 1, 2019 (continued)

i. As a lessee (continued)

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

ii. As a lessor

When the group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

Generally, the accounting policies applicable to the group as a lessor in the comparative period were not different from IFRS 16 except for the classification of a sub-lease entered into during the current reporting period that resulted in a finance lease classification.

Policy applicable before January 1, 2019

Leases under which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.

Assets acquired under finance leasing arrangements are measured at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses. After deducting interest attributable to future periods, the net amount payable is included in accounts payable.

Assets held under other leases were classified as operating leases and were not recognised in the group’s balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases were recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

(p) Employee benefits

Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by the group in exchange for service rendered by employees. These include current or short-term benefits such as salaries, bonuses, national insurance contributions, annual leave and non-monetary benefits such as medical care and housing, post-employment benefits such as pensions and other long-term employee benefits such as termination benefits. Employee benefits that are earned as a result of past or current service are recognised in the following manner:

• Current employee benefits are recognised as a liability, net of payments made, and charged as expense. The expected cost of vacation leave that accumulates is recognised when the employees become entitled to the leave.

• Pension obligations

The group, through its subsidiaries, participates in defined benefit retirement plans, the assets of which are generally held in separate trustee-administered funds. The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and by the group, taking into account the recommendations of qualified actuaries. The group has defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

The asset or liability recognised in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs.

The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

The group also participates in defined contribution plans whereby it pays contributions to privately administered pension plans which are administered by trustees. Once the contributions have been paid, the group has no further payment obligations. The contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

• Other retirement obligations

The group, through its subsidiaries, provides post-employment health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.

(p) Employee benefits (continued)

• Other retirement obligations (continued)

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.

• Termination benefits

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the group recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.

(q) Revenue

Performance obligations and revenue recognition policies:

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The group recognises revenue when it transfers control over goods or service to a customer.

A contract with a customer that results in a recognised financial instrument in the group’s financial statements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is the case, then the group first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual.

The nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers, including significant payment terms, and the related revenue recognition policies are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type of revenue</th>
    <th>Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms.</th>
    <th>Revenue recognition under IFRS 15</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terminal and logistics services</td>
    <td>The group provides a full range of cargo handling, logistics, freight forwarding and trans-shipment services. Fees to its customers are calculated based on specific tariffs and charged based on services rendered.</td>
    <td>Generally recognised at the point in time that the service is delivered.</td>

    <td>The group provides goods to its customers. Customers obtain control of products when the goods are delivered to and have been accepted at their premises, or in certain cases when the goods have been collected from a group’s premises. Invoices are generated at that point and are payable within a range of terms that vary from immediately to 45 days.<br><br>Some contracts allow customers to return goods. Returned goods are exchanged for new goods or, in certain cases, are refunded through credit notes.</td>
    <td>Recognised at the point in time that the goods are delivered and have been accepted by the customers at their premises. For contracts that permit return of goods, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.<br><br>The group has a very low level of returned goods. Where applicable, the right to recover returned goods is measured at the former carrying amount of inventory less any expected cost to recover.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(r) Finance costs

Finance costs represent interest payable and amortised borrowing costs on calculated using the effective interest method.

(s) Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated taking into account the effective interest rate on the asset.

(t) Taxation

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognised in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date.

*End of Page 32*

### Page 33

4. Significant accounting policies (continued)

(t) Taxation (continued)

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(u) Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the group:
(i) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components.
(ii) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and
(iii) for which discrete financial information is available.

Segment results that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

5. Short-term investments

This comprises fixed deposits.

6. Securities purchased under resale agreements

The fair value of the underlying securities purchased under resale agreements approximated $5,567,531,000 (2018: $2,686,329,000).

(i) The group has a 40% holding in Tortuga Cayman Limited, a company that manufactures and distributes baked products, through its subsidiary Tortuga International Holdings Limited.

(ii) During the prior year the group, through its subsidiary KW Logistics Limited, acquired a 50% shareholding in KW Warehousing Services Limited (formerly: SSL REIT Limited), for consideration of $61,605,000.

During the current year, KW Logistics Limited acquired the remaining 50% shareholding for consideration of $64,404,000 and has accordingly now recognised SSL REIT Limited as a subsidiary.

(iii) The company directly holds 20% of the shares of SAJE Logistics and Infrastructure Limited (formerly Shipping Association of Jamaica Property Limited). The group indirectly holds a further 10% shareholding in SAJE through its subsidiary Kingston Wharves Limited.

(b) The share of profits from associate companies and joint ventures for the year amounted to $13,093,000 (2018: $119,929,000).

(c) The other financial asset represented a loan to the group’s former joint venture, SSL REIT Limited, of $470,000,000. Upon this entity being recognised as a subsidiary this financial asset was eliminated on consolidation.

13. Investments

Included in investments is a long-term third party loan of US$1,140,000 (2018: US$1,195,000) receivable in equal monthly payments over fifteen years. It commenced in 2010 and included a one-year principal moratorium for the first year. The loan, which earns interest at 3% per annum, is secured by a first mortgage over property and liens over plant, equipment, inventories and any other assets owned by the borrower. In addition, a first lien is held over the shares held by the borrower in former subsidiaries that own the assets pledged as security.

An impairment allowance of US$378,000 (2018: US$378,000) has been recognised against this loan.

In 2018, as a result of the group’s impairment assessment, the value in use of certain customer relationships was identified to be lower than the carrying amount because of lower than previously expected future EBITDA margins. Accordingly, an impairment of $36,362,000 was recognised to reflect this reduction in recoverable amount.

14. Intangible assets (continued)

In testing goodwill for impairment, recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are estimated based on value-in-use. Where the recoverable amounts exceed the carrying amounts, no impairment allowance is made. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are arrived at by estimating their future cash flows and discounting those cash flows using long-term discount rates applicable to the countries in which the businesses operate. Future sustainable cash flows are estimated based on the most recent forecasts, after taking account of past experience. In all cases projected cash flows are estimated over 5 years, followed by a terminal value calculated based on the discount rates and growth rates in the table below. Each unit is regarded as saleable to a third party at a future date at a price sufficient to recover its carrying amount of goodwill. Key assumptions are set out below:

18. Employee benefit asset and obligations

The group participates in benefit plans for its employees, summarised as follows:

(i) Four defined contribution schemes for qualifying employees in Jamaica and another in the United Kingdom.

(ii) An industry-wide multi-employer defined benefit scheme in the Netherlands. The subsidiary is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the scheme to fund the benefits. This percentage may increase or decrease as a result of changes in actuarial valuations. The only obligation of the group with respect to this scheme is to make the specified contributions. Accordingly, it is treated as a defined contribution scheme for the purpose of the group’s financial reporting.

(iii) A defined benefit scheme for certain employees of its subsidiary also in the Netherlands. The group has contracted out all legal and constructive commitments of this scheme to an insurance company and is only obliged to make annual specified contributions. Accordingly, this scheme is treated as a defined contribution scheme for the purpose of the group’s financial reporting.

(iv) A defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme operated by Kingston Wharves Limited (KW). KW also provides other retirement benefits giving rise to obligations. The assets of the funded plans are held independently in separate trustee administered funds.

The effect on the balance sheet, profit for the year and other comprehensive income are as follows:

18. Employee benefit asset and obligations (continued)

(a) Defined benefit pension plan

The Kingston Wharves scheme is open to all permanent employees of that subsidiary. Under the scheme, retirement benefits are based on average salary during the three years preceding retirement. The scheme is funded by employee contributions at 5% and employer contributions of 1% of salary, as recommended by independent actuaries. Members may also make voluntary contributions of up to 5% of their earnings.

The assets of the plan are held independently of the group’s assets in a separate trustee-administered fund. The plan is valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.

The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet is determined as follows:

(a) Defined benefit pension plan (continued)

Expected contributions to the post-employment plan for the year ending December 31, 2020 are $3,000,000 (2019: $4,700,000).

The significant actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2019</th>
    <th>2018</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Discount rate</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expected pension increase</td>
    <td>3.00%</td>
    <td>2.00%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65.

The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

<table>

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.

(b) Other retirement benefits

Kingston Wharves Limited operates both a group health plan and a group life plan. KW covers 100% of the premiums of both plans. However, pensioners under the health plan have the option to pay an additional premium for dependents’ coverage.

The method of accounting and the frequency of valuations for these plans are similar to those used for the defined benefit pension scheme. In addition to the assumptions used for the pension scheme, the main actuarial assumption is a long term increase in health costs of 6% (2018: 5%) per year for the insured group health plan. The insured group life plan assumes a salary rate increase of 5% (2018: 4%) per year.

(c) Risks associated with pension plans and other post-employment plans

Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the subsidiary is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

*End of Page 44*

---

### Page 45

18. Retirement benefit asset and obligations (continued)

(c) Risks associated with pension plans and other post-employment plans (continued)

Asset volatility

The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to Government of Jamaica bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.

However, the subsidiary believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long term strategy to manage plans efficiently.

Changes in bond yields

A decrease in Government of Jamaica bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings.

Inflation risk

Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the plan’s assets are unaffected by fixed interest bonds, meaning that an increase in inflation will reduce the surplus or create a deficit.

Life expectancy

The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. This is particularly significant, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation for pension scheme is 15 years.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits is 17 years and 12 years respectively.

(i) Reserve for own shares is included in these financial statements by consolidation of the company’s Employee’s Share Ownership Plan (ESOP), which is regarded as a structured entity and is required to be consolidated under IFRS 10. The reserve comprises the cost of the company’s shares held by the group through the ESOP, less net gains on shares sold.

The consolidated financial statements include the group’s share of profits or loss of the ESOP based on management accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019. The results of operation of this entity are immaterial in relation to the group.

The number of stock units held by the ESOP at December 31, 2019 was 76,474,118 (2018: 77,473,991). Based on the bid price, less a 15% discount normally allowed to staff, the value of those stock units at December 31, 2019 was $1,771,332,000 (2018: $1,448,764,000). The fair value of these stock units is not recognised in the group’s reserve for own shares until sold.

(ii) Other capital reserves comprise gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment and investments up to December 31, 2019, unrealised exchange gains and unclaimed distributions to stockholders (note 28).

(iii) Losses in a subsidiary, in excess of the non-controlling interest in the equity of the subsidiary, were included in the group’s results prior to 2010. Should the subsidiary subsequently report profits, such profits would be included in the group results, until the non-controlling interest’s share of losses, previously absorbed by the group, has been recovered.

(i) On September 29, 2017, the company issued a Corporate bond for $1,500,000,000. This note is secured by shares in Kingston Wharves Limited (KW) and is repayable by September 2024 through semi-annual payments and a lump sum payment of $700,000,000 in the final year. The interest rate on the loan was originally fixed at 9% p.a. for the first five years and thereafter at the GOJ 6-month Weighted Average Treasury Bill Yield (WATBY) plus 200 basis points, capped at 12% p.a. With effect from September 28, 2018, following agreement with bondholders, the interest rate for the subsequent four years was revised to 6.4% and for the subsequent period the cap was revised to 10% p.a. All other terms remain consistent. The proceeds of this note were principally used to refinance two previous notes.

(ii) During 2018, KW drew down $519,000,000, being the final tranche of a $1,800,000,000 facility established to finance capital expenditure. The interest rate varies over the life of the loan, with rates fixed at 7.0% p.a.for the first three years and capped at 7.5% p.a. for the remaining life. The total facility had a two-year moratorium on principal payments during the draw-down period and is thereafter repayable in 20 instalments, ending in 2023, of $63,000,000, with a final payment of $540,000,000.

(iii) The loan from other related party of $159,997,000 is due to a company that holds 30% of the equity in JP Snacks Caribbean Limited. The loan, which is denominated in US dollars, is repayable in 2026.

21. Loans and borrowings (continued)

(iv) The loan from other related party of $87,197,000 is due to a company that holds 35% of the equity in Four Rivers Mining Company Limited. The loan is due on demand.

(v) During the year, a subsidiary entered into two new finances leases for plant and equipment of €1,099,000 repayable over 72 months and €1,452,000 repayable over 72 months.

22. Leases (IFRS 16)

(i) As a lessee

The group leases property and equipment. The leases typically run for 3 to 10 years, with options to renew. Some leases may have options for periodic rate adjustments to reflect market rentals. Some leases provide for additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. Previously, these leases were classified as operating leases under IAS 17. The group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases that are short-term and/or leases of low-value items.

Information about leases for which the group is a lessee is presented below.

(e) Extension options

Some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the group up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where deemed appropriate, the group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the lessors. The group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.

The group has estimated that potential future lease payments, should it exercise extension options in these leases, would result in an increase in lease liability of $187,452,000.

(ii) As a lessor

a) Operating lease

The group leases out property. The group has classified these leases as operating leases, because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets.

Rental income recognised by the group during 2019 was $197,830,000 (2018: $185,170,000).

The following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease payments, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date.

26. Taxation (continued)

(b) Reconciliation of tax expense

The effective tax rate for 2019 was 20.4% (2018: 18.4%), compared to the statutory tax rate of the company of 25% (2018: 25%). The actual charge differs from the "expected" tax charge for the year as follows:

(c) As at December 31, 2019, the company and certain subsidiaries had taxation losses, subject to agreement by the Commissioner General, Tax Administration Jamaica, of approximately $3,808,421,041 (2018: $3,837,339,000) available for relief against future taxable profits. Of this amount, $570,819,000 (2018: $570,819,000) is available for offset against specific income such as farming profits. As of January 1, 2014, tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely; however, the amount that can be utilised is restricted to 50% of chargeable income (before prior year losses) in any one year. A deferred tax asset of $952,105,260 (2018: $959,335,000) in respect of taxation losses of certain companies has not been recognised by the group, as management considers its realisation within the foreseeable future to be too uncertain.

27. Profit per ordinary stock unit

The profit per ordinary stock unit is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to stockholders of $1,204,338,000 (2018: $815,621,000), by a weighted average number of ordinary stock units held during the year, as follows:

32. Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of an enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise. For the purpose of the financial statements, financial assets have been determined to include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, securities purchased under resale agreements, accounts receivable and investments. Financial liabilities include bank overdrafts, credit facilities and short-term loans, accounts payable and long-term loans.

(a) Fair value of financial instruments

Fair value amounts represent estimates of the arm’s length consideration for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act. Fair value is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, securities purchased under resale agreements, accounts receivable, credit facilities and short-term loans and accounts payable are assumed to approximate their carrying values due to their relatively short-term nature. The fair value of investments, as disclosed in note 13, are assumed to be cost, less allowance for impairment.

The fair value for long-term loans is assumed to approximate carrying value, as no discount on settlement is anticipated.

(b) Financial instrument risks

The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk including interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk. Information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk is detailed below.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s risk management framework.

The risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the group’s activities. Management’s standards and procedures aim to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

(i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. This arises principally from cash and cash equivalents, financial investments, securities purchased under resale agreements and accounts receivable.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is equal to the carrying value.

32. Financial instruments (continued)

(b) Financial instrument risks (continued)

(i) Credit risk (continued)

The group manages this risk as follows:

• Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments

The group maintains cash resources with reputable financial institutions. The credit risk is considered to be low. The allowance for expected credit loss is immaterial.

• Securities purchased under resale agreements

The group holds collateral for securities purchased under resale agreements. The allowance for expected credit loss is immaterial.

• Accounts receivable

The group has a credit policy in place to minimise exposure to credit risk inherent in trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit. Credit terms are negotiated based on a mix of terms acceptable to both parties. The group provides credit up to 60 days, dependent on other pricing arrangements that may be beneficial to the relationship. A continuing relationship with customers is dependent upon adherence to the credit terms.

Allowances are determined upon origination of the trade accounts receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss ("ECL") of the trade accounts receivable and are reviewed over the lifetime of the trade receivables.

The group estimates ECL on trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience as well as the credit risk and expected developments for each group of customers. The following tables provide information about the ECL for trade receivables as at the reporting date.

Staff and other receivables are subject to credit terms consistent with staff guidelines and other factors, including Jamaican GCT, and the Netherlands and U.K. VAT. These guidelines include the provision of collateral as security for credit extended.

• Non-current investments

The loan to the purchaser of former subsidiaries, net of impairment allowance, is considered to be adequately secured. The estimated allowance for any further impairment is immaterial.

(ii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the group’s income or the fair value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on assets.

The group manages this risk by conducting research and monitoring the price movement of securities on the local and international markets.

There were no changes in the group’s approach to managing market risk during the year.

Currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

The group is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the Jamaican dollar. The main currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro (EUR), United States dollar (USD) and Pound Sterling (GBP).

The group manages this risk by matching foreign currency assets with liabilities as far as possible. Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash inflows generated by the underlying operations in which the borrowings are invested. This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.

There were no changes in the group’s approach to managing foreign currency risk during the year.

The net foreign currency assets/(liabilities) at year-end were as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

The following tables detail the group’s sensitivity to a 6% strengthening or 4% weakening (2018: 4% strengthening and 2% weakening) of the relevant currencies against the Jamaica dollar and the resultant net exchange gains/(losses) based on net foreign currency assets/(liabilities) at year-end. These percentages represent management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign currency rates.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and is performed on the same basis as the previous year.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

The group contracts material financial liabilities at fixed interest rates. Credit facilities are subject to interest rates which may be varied with appropriate notice by the lender.

  </tr>

There were no changes in the group’s approach to managing interest rate risk during the year.

Other price risk

Other price risk is the risk that the value of certain financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or all factors affecting instruments traded in the market. As the group’s equity instruments are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the revaluation reserve, all changes in market conditions would affect other comprehensive income (OCI).

The group’s exposure to price risk is represented by the total carrying value of equity investments of $24,727,000 (2018: Nil).

Sensitivity to movements in equity prices

Sensitivity is measured by computing the impact on shareholders’ equity of a reasonably probable change in equity prices.

The group’s equity investments are listed locally on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. A 10% (2018: Nil) increase in stock prices at the reporting date would have increased profit and loss by $2,472,700 (2018: Nil); an equal decrease would have decreased profit and loss by an equal amount.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

An increase of 100 basis points (bps) or a decrease of 100 bps in interest rates at the reporting date would have (decreased)/increased profit for the year by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. This analysis is performed on the same basis for the previous year.

(iii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk, also referred to as funding risk, is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and/or encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at, or close to, its fair value.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities.

Management of the group aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by ensuring that sufficient cash resources are held or placed in short-term marketable instruments to meet financial obligations when they fall due.

There were no changes in the group’s approach to liquidity risk management during the year.

The tables below show the undiscounted cash flows of non-derivative financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay. The analysis also assumes that all other variables, in particular interest and exchange rates, remain constant.

(iv) Capital management

There were no changes in the group’s approach to capital management during the year. The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the group defines as total stockholders’ equity, excluding non-controlling interest. The level of dividends to ordinary stockholders is also monitored in accordance with the group’s stated dividend policy.

The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

33. Subsidiaries, associates and joint venture companies
