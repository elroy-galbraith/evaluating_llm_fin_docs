INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of
CARRERAS LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Carreras Limited (“the company”) comprising the separate financial statements of the company and the consolidated financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”), set out on pages 8 to 52, which comprise the group’s and company’s statement of financial position as at March 31, 2019, the group’s and company’s statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the company as at March 31, 2019, and of the group’s and company’s financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matter

Key audit matter is a matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
CARRERAS LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group and the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the Appendix to this auditors’ report. This description, which is located at pages 6 to 7, forms part of our auditors’ report.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been maintained, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Nyssa Johnson.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
CARRERAS LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ report

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

To the Members of
CARRERAS LIMITED

Appendix to the Independent Auditors’ report (continued)

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

CARRERAS LIMITED

Notes to the Financial Statements
March 31, 2019

1. Identification and principal activity

Carreras Limited ("the company") is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica and is listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. It is a 50.4% subsidiary of Rothmans Holdings (Caricom) Limited, which is incorporated in St. Lucia. The ultimate parent company is British American Tobacco plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The principal activities of the company are the marketing and distribution of cigarettes.

The address of the principal place of business and the registered office of the company is 13A Ripon Road, Kingston 5, Jamaica.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation

(a) Statement of compliance:

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

This is the first set of the group’s annual financial statements in which IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, have been applied. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 3.

A summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 22.

(b) Basis of measurement and functional currency:

The financial statements are presented on the historical cost basis. Unless otherwise stated, the financial statements are presented in thousands of Jamaica dollars ($'000), which is the functional currency of the company.

(c) Accounting estimates and judgements:

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of, and disclosures related to, assets, liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the reporting date and the income and expenses for the year then ended. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and/or various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty:

• Employee benefits [see notes 10 and 22(o)]:

The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for pension and other post-employment benefits are determined actuarially using several assumptions. The primary assumptions used in determining the amounts recognised include the discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows required to settle the pension and other post-employment obligations and the expected rate of increase in medical costs for post-employment medical benefits.

Any changes in these assumptions would impact the amounts recorded in the financial statements for these obligations.

2. Statement of compliance and basis of preparation (cont’d)

(c) Accounting estimates and judgements (cont’d):

• Allowance for impairment losses [see notes 13 and 22(p)]:

Allowances for doubtful accounts were established until March 31, 2018, based on incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts considering aging of balances, the credit history and risk profile of each customer and legal processes to recover accounts receivable. Effective April 1, 2018, such allowances are determined upon origination of the trade accounts receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss (“ECL”) on trade accounts receivable.

Under the ECL model, the group analyses its accounts receivable in a matrix by days past due and determined for each age bracket an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 3 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable.

The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the applicable ageing bracket.

3. Changes in significant accounting policies

The group has initially adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from April 1, 2018.

A number of other new standards were also effective from April 1, 2018 but they do not have a material effect on the group’s and company’s financial statements.

Due to the transition method chosen by the group and company in applying IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not generally been restated to reflect the requirements of these new standards.

The effect of initially applying these standards is mainly attributed to the following:

– additional disclosures related to IFRS 9 [see notes 18(i) and 22 (p)]
– additional disclosures related to IFRS 15 [see note 22 (l)].

Except for the changes below, the company has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in note 22 to all periods presented in these financial statements.

IFRS 15, Revenue from Contract with Customers

Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, following a five step model: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer (agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations); Step 2: Identify the different performance obligations (promises) in the contract and account for those separately; Step 3: Determine the transaction price (amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services); Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or service; and Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time.

3. Changes in significant accounting policies (cont’d)

IFRS 15, Revenue from Contract with Customers (cont’d)

IFRS 15 also includes disclosure requirements to provide comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers. IFRS 15 was effective on April 1, 2018, and supersedes all existing guidance on revenue recognition.

The adoption of IFRS 15 did not impact the timing or amount of sales from contracts with customers and the related assets and liabilities recognised by the company. Accordingly, the impact on the comparative information is limited to new disclosure requirements.

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The requirements of IFRS 9 represent a significant change from IAS 39. The new standard brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities.

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the company has adopted consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which require impairment of financial assets to be presented separate in the statement of profit or loss and OCI.

Additionally, the group has adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2019, but have not been applied to the comparative information.

Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale.

For an explanation of how the company classifies and measures financial instruments under IFRS 9, see note 22 (s).

The following table and the accompanying note below explain the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the group’s and company’s financial assets as at April 1, 2018.

(a) Trade and other receivables that were classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 are now classified at amortised cost. No allowance for impairment over these receivables was recognised for transition adjustment on initial application of IFRS 9 as at April 1, 2018 as the amounts were considered immaterial.

Impairment of financial assets

IFRS 9 replace the “incurred loss” model in IAS 39 with an “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognised earlier than under IAS 39 (see note 18).

Transition

For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment loses are generally expected to increase and become more volatile. The group and company has determined that application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at April 1, 2018 has not given rise to any material change in the group’s and company’s impairment allowance.

Additional information about how the company measures allowance for impairment is described in [note 22 (p)].

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (cont’d)

Impairment of financial assets (cont’d)

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, except that comparative periods generally have not been restated. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings as at April 1, 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2018, does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2019 under IFRS 9.

4. Operating revenue

Operating revenue for the group and the company represents the invoiced value of products and services sold and includes special consumption tax aggregating $5,593,796,000 (2018: $5,417,449,000).

10. Employee benefits

The Carreras Group Limited Superannuation Scheme ("the old scheme") was discontinued with effect from December 31, 2006 and is being wound up in accordance with the rules, applicable legislation and subject to the oversight of the Financial Services Commission ("FSC"). Benefit improvements have been agreed for the pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members of the old scheme.

10. Employee benefits (cont’d)

A replacement fund, the Carreras Limited Superannuation Fund (“the new fund”) was established with effect from January 1, 2007. The new fund is divided into two sections – a defined benefit (DB) section and a defined contribution (DC) section. The employees who were members of the old scheme are now participating in the DB section of the new fund whilst the individuals employed after December 31, 2006, are participating in the DC section of the new fund.

The liabilities in respect of current pensioners and deferred pensioners, who opted to transfer the value of their pension entitlement in the old scheme to the DB section of the new fund to provide for all future pension payments, have been transferred to the DB section. The liabilities in respect of the active members who became members of the new fund and opted to transfer the total or a part of their past service to the new fund have also been transferred.

The amounts recognised are computed as follows:

During the year, net bad debts recognised in profit or loss aggregated $5,774,000 (2018: $2,095,000) for the group and the company.

Allowances for doubtful accounts were established until March 31, 2018 based on incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts considering aging of balances, the credit history and risk profile of each customer and legal processes to recover accounts receivable. Effective April 1, 2018 such allowances are determined upon origination of the trade accounts receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss ("ECL") of the trade accounts receivable and are recognised over their term.

Under this ECL model, the group uses accounts receivable based on days past due and determines an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 12 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable. A weighted average ECL rate is used as at March 31, 2019 to apply against the accounts receivable balance (see note 18).

(c) The group has not recognised a deferred tax asset arising in subsidiaries amounting to $194,370,000 (2018: $194,370,000) in respect of unutilised tax losses of subsidiaries because it is not probable that the subsidiaries will have sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future to realise this benefit [see note 8(c)].

18. Financial instruments and risk management

The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

• Credit risk

• Market risk

This note presents information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the group’s and the company’s management of capital.

18. Financial instruments and risk management (cont’d)

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s and the company’s risk management framework. Senior management has responsibility for monitoring the group’s risk management policies and report to delegates of the Board of Directors on its activities, on a monthly basis.

The risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies are reviewed on a regular basis and reflect changes in market conditions and the group’s activities.

(i) Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a counterparty to a financial contract failing to discharge its obligations, and arises principally from the group’s receivables from customers, cash and investment securities.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.

Trade receivables

The group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Management has established a credit policy under which each customer is analysed for creditworthiness prior to being offered a credit facility. Each customer is given a credit period which represents the maximum time allowed for having balances outstanding; these are reviewed monthly. Management has procedures in place to restrict customer orders if the customers have not cleared outstanding debts within the credit period. Customers that fail to meet the group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact business with the group on a cash basis.

The group’s average credit period on the sale of goods is 28 days for certain established large (wholesale) customers and 7 days for other (retail) customers. Credit risk is monitored according to each customer’s characteristics, such as whether it is an individual or company, its geographic location, industry, aging profile and financial history.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by type of customer was:

Expected credit loss assessment as at April 1, 2018

The group uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit losses (ECLs) in respect of trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward looking estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Management has an investment policy in place and the group’s and the company’s exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable financial institutions. Credit risk is considered to be low. The allowance for impairment is immaterial.

(ii) Market risk:

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risk.

(a) Interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

At the reporting date the interest profile of the company’s and the group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

(iii) Liquidity risk:

Liquidity risk, also referred to as funding risk, is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity problems may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at, or close to, its fair value. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, and ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities. The group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a substantial portion of its financial assets in highly liquid assets.

The contractual outflows as at March 31, 2019 and 2018 for trade accounts payable, General Consumption Tax payable, due to related parties, employee related payables, unclaimed dividends and other payables are represented by their carrying amounts and may require settlement within 12 months of the reporting date.

(iv) Capital management:

The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the group defines as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity.

The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.

There were no changes in the group’s approach to capital management during the year. Also, the group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

It is not applicable when an entity measures the related asset, expense or income or initial recognition at fair value or at the fair value of the consideration paid or received at the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary asset or liability.

An entity is not required to apply this interpretation to income taxes or insurance contracts that it issues or reinsurance contracts held.

The interpretation clarifies that the transaction date is the date on which the group initially recognises the prepayment or deferred income arising from the advance consideration. For transactions involving multiple payments or receipts, each payment or receipt gives rise to a separate transaction date.</td>

The adoption of this interpretation did not result in any significant change to the presentation and disclosures in the financial statements.

The group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

(a) Basis of consolidation:

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

The consolidated financial statements combine the financial position of the company and its subsidiaries as at March 31, 2018 and their results of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, after eliminating significant intra-group amounts. The company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to in the financial statements as “the Group”.

(b) Non-controlling interests (NCI):

NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

NCI relates to a 0.03% interest in Cigarette Company of Jamaica Limited, which was liquidated, and non-controlling interests are insignificant to the consolidated financial statements.

(c) Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash comprises cash in hand and demand and call deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, rather than for investment or other purposes. The amounts included are short-term fixed deposits.

(d) Accounts receivable:

Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost, less impairment losses [see note 22(p)].

(e) Accounts payable:

Accounts payable are measured at amortised cost.

A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(f) Inventories:

Inventories comprising finished products are measured at the lower of cost, determined principally on the weighted average cost basis, and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling expenses.

(g) Investment in subsidiaries:

The company’s investment in subsidiaries is measured at cost.

(h) Related parties:

A related party is a person or company that is related to the entity which is preparing its financial statements (referred to in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures as the “reporting entity”).

(i) A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:

(a) has control or joint control over the reporting entity;
(b) has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
(c) is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.

22. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

(h) Related parties (cont’d):

    (ii) An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:
        (a) The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).
        (b) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
        (c) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
        (d) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.
        (e) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity.
        (f) The entity is controlled, or jointly controlled, by a person identified in (i).
        (g) A person identified in (i)(a) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).
        (h) The entity or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management services to the entity.

A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.

The company has related party relationships with its ultimate parent company, British American Tobacco plc (BAT) and other subsidiaries and affiliates of the BAT Group, its subsidiaries, directors and key management personnel and companies with common directors, and its pension schemes. “Key management personnel” comprises the group’s leadership team which includes executive directors and specified senior officers.

(i) Property, plant and equipment:

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied in the part will flow to the group and its cost can be reliably measured.

The cost of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

With the exception of freehold land and work-in-progress, on which no depreciation is provided, property, plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets, at the following annual rates:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buildings</td>
    <td>1.4% to 2.5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>8% to 11%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Machinery, furniture and equipment</td>
    <td>3.3% to 33.3%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Motor vehicles</td>
    <td>20% to 33.3%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually at each reporting date.

(j) Income tax:

Income tax on profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.

(i) Current income tax:

Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to income tax payable in respect of previous years.

(ii) Deferred income tax:

Deferred income tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the reporting date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

(k) Foreign currencies:

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of those transactions. The group’s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to Jamaica dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at that date. Gains and losses arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are included in profit or loss.

(l) Revenue recognition:

The effect of initially applying IFRS 15 on the company’s revenue from contracts is described in note 3.

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 (applicable from April 1, 2018)

Performance obligations and revenue recognition policies:

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The company recognises revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer.

Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms

Revenue is recognised at a point in time in the amount of the price before tax on sales expected to be received by the company for the supply of goods, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled, when the goods are delivered and have been accepted by the customers.

Invoices are usually payable within 7 to 45 days.

### Page 44

22. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

(l) Revenue recognition (cont’d):

Revenue recognition under IAS 18 (applicable before April 1, 2018)

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, volume rebates and sales taxes.

Revenue is recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, receipt of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, and there is no continuing involvement with the goods.

(m) Other operating income:

Other operating income is mainly comprised of interest income, gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment and refund of pension surplus. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

(n) Leases:

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

(o) Employee benefits:

Employee benefits comprising pensions and other post-employment assets and obligations included in these financial statements have been actuarially determined by a qualified independent actuary, appointed by management. The appointed actuary’s report outlines the scope of the valuation and the actuary’s opinion. The actuarial valuations are conducted in accordance with IAS 19, and the financial statements reflect the group’s and the company’s post-employment benefits assets and obligations as computed by the actuary. In carrying out their audit, the auditors make use of the work of the actuary and the actuary’s report.

(i) Pension assets:

The company and its subsidiaries are participating employers in a pension scheme, the assets of which are held separately from those of the group, and remain under the full control of the appointed trustees.

The group’s net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that value is discounted to determine the present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. To the extent that the obligation is less than the fair value of scheme assets, the asset recognised is restricted to the discounted value of unconditional future benefits available to the group in the form of any future refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. The discount rate applied is the yield at the reporting date on long-term government instruments that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the group’s obligation. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

(o) Employee benefits (cont’d):

    (i) Pension assets (cont’d):

        Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The company determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any changes during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

        When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The company recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

        Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.

    (ii) Other post-retirement health and group life insurance benefits:

        The group provides post-retirement health care and group life insurance benefits, which are not entitlements, to certain of its retirees. These benefits are usually conditional upon the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans and the present value of future benefits at the reporting date is shown as an obligation on the statement of financial position.

        Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in a manner similar to the defined benefit pension plan.

    (iii) Other employee benefits:

        Employee leave entitlements are recognised as they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for vacation and sick leave, as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.

(p) Impairment:

Financial assets

Policy applicable from April 1, 2018

The group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost. The company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

### Page 46

22. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

(p) Impairment (cont’d):

Financial assets (cont’d)

Policy applicable from April 1, 2018 (cont’d)

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the company considers reasonable and supportable information relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information.

The company assumes that the credit risk on financial assets has increased significantly if it is more than 90 days past due.

The company recognises loss allowances for ECLs and considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the company in full, without recourse by the company to action such as realising security if any is held; or

- the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

Life-time ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the company is exposed to credit risk.

Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the company expects to receive).

ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised costs are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

(p) Impairment (cont’d):

Policy applicable from April 1, 2018 (cont’d)

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

Write-off

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is the case when the company determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Policy applicable before April 1, 2018

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

(i) Calculation of recoverable amount:

The recoverable amount of investments in loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale investment is calculated by reference to its current fair value. Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.

The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

(ii) Reversals of impairment:

An impairment loss in respect of receivables is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

22. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

(p) Impairment (cont’d):

Policy applicable before April 1, 2018 (cont’d)

(ii) Reversals of impairment (cont’d):

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Reversal of impairment losses is recognised in profit or loss, except for available-for-sale equity securities, which is recognised in other comprehensive income.

(q) Determination of profit or loss:

Profit is determined as the difference between the revenues from the goods and services rendered and the costs and other charges incurred during the year. Profits on transactions are taken in the year in which they are realised. A transaction is realised at the moment of delivery. Losses are taken in the year in which they are realised or determinable.

(r) Segment reporting:

A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged either in providing products (business segment), or in providing products within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.

The group’s activities are limited to the distribution of cigarettes to Jamaican consumers, operating in a single segment As such no additional segment information is provided.

(s) Financial instruments:

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise. For the purpose of these financial statements, financial assets have been determined to include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Similarly, financial liabilities mainly comprise accounts payable.

(i) Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

(s) Financial instruments (cont’d):

(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets – Policy applicable from April 1, 2018

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) – debt investment; FVOCI – equity investment; or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the company changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

- it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).

Amortised cost represents the net present value (“NPV”) of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:

▪ Cash and cash equivalents
▪ Trade and other receivables

Due to their short-term nature, the company initially recognises these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

Financial assets – Business model assessment: Policy applicable from April 1, 2018

The company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.

Financial assets – Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest: Policy applicable from April 1, 2018

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont’d)

Financial assets – Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest: Policy applicable from April 1, 2018 (cont’d)

The company’s objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.

Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. The company’s financial liabilities, which mainly comprise accounts payables is recognised initially at fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities – Subsequent measurement and gains and losses: Policy applicable from April 1, 2018

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in the particular recognition methods disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item.

Financial assets and liabilities– Policy applicable before April 1, 2018

The company classified non-derivative financial assets as Loans and receivables: measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The company classified non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.

(iii) Derecognition

Financial assets

The company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

(s) Financial instruments (cont’d):

(iii) Derecognition (cont’d)

Financial assets (cont’d)

The company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

(iv) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(t) Fair value:

Definition of fair value:

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument.

Determination of fair value:

The company’s financial instruments lack an available trading market. The fair value of all financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are considered to approximate their carrying values, due to their short-term nature. The fair values of amounts due from and due to subsidiary companies are assumed to approximate carrying values.

(u) Dividends and distributions:

Dividends and distributions are recognised in the period in which they are declared.

23. New and amended standards issued but not yet effective

At the date of approval of the financial statements, a number of new standards and amendments to standards, were in issue but were not yet effective and which the group has not early adopted. Those which management considered may be relevant to the group are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>New or amended standards</th>
    <th>Summary of the requirements</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>IFRS 16, Leases</b></td>
    <td>Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, this standard eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. Entities will be required to bring all major leases on-balance sheet, recognising new assets and liabilities. The on-balance sheet liability will attract interest; the total lease expense will be higher in the early years of a lease even if a lease has fixed regular cash rentals. Optional lessee exemption will apply to short-term leases and for low-value items with value of US$5,000 or less.

Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice as the lessor will continue to classify leases as finance and operating leases.. The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2019, with no restatement of comparative information.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><i>Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</i></td>
    <td>This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and provides a definition of ‘material’ to guide preparers of financial statements in making judgements about information to be included in financial statements.

<i>“Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.”</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>IFRIC 23, Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments</b></td>
    <td>Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted. IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.

An entity has to consider whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority would accept the tax treatment, or group of tax treatments, that is adopted in its income tax filing.

If the entity concludes that it is probable that the tax authority will accept a particular tax treatment in the tax return, the entity will determine taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment included in its income tax filings and record the same amount in the financial statements. The entity will disclose uncertainty.

If the entity concludes that it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted, the entity has to use the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.</td>

The group is assessing the impact that these new standards, amendments and interpretations will have on its 2020 and 2021 financial statements.
