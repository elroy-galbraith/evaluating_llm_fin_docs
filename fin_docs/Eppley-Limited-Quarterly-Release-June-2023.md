Letter to Shareholders

August 14, 2023

Fellow Shareholders,

Eppley produced earnings per share of $1.85 in the first half of 2023, generating a 58% return for shareholders.¹

Proprietary Investment Portfolio
At the end of June 2023, we owned a $5.8 billion investment portfolio consisting of cash, loans, leases, receivables and investments in our mezzanine, real estate, infrastructure and asset management joint ventures, subsidiaries and associates. The average income yield of our portfolio was 14% and 16% excluding our cash balances.

Asset Management Business
In addition to our proprietary portfolio, we also manage or administer the equivalent of over US$120 million of capital primarily through the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund, Caribbean Mezzanine Fund and Capital Infrastructure Group.

Capitalization and Liquidity
Our leverage was 3.6x our capital at the end of the first quarter and our average cost of debt was 6%. We closed the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash.

Financial Performance
Our profit after tax for the first half of 2023 was $357 million when compared against $110 million generated for the first half of last year.

The financial performance for the first half of 2023 now reflects the impact of the tender for the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund-Development Fund shares which resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of $229 million.

Additional funding obtained to facilitate the purchase of the Development Fund shares resulted in an increase in interest expenses for the period.

Our core business remains solid. Excluding the impact of the gain on bargain purchase from the Development Fund, our profitability for the six-month period would have been approximately $150 million or 36% higher than the corresponding period of the previous year.

¹ Based on a cost basis of $3.21 per share which assumes an investor subscribed in the IPO and fully participated in our rights issue.

### Page 5

The recurring, predictable fee income generated from managing or administering assets in our real estate, mezzanine and infrastructure strategies continued to grow, improving the quality of our earnings.

Dividend
Today the Board of Directors approved a dividend of 5.2 cents per share payable on September 15, 2023, to ordinary shareholders on record as of August 31, 2023.

Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, we expect to maintain our dividend policy in future periods.

Outlook
Following the acquisition, the Development Fund is now consolidated into Eppley's financial statements. We will continue to execute the current strategy of divesting the Development Fund's real estate assets at or above carrying value while assessing repositioning its mandate.

The outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive supported by a healthy pipeline of opportunities across the different strategies we manage.
Sincerely,

P.B Scott
Chairman

Nicholas A. Scott
Vice Chairman
