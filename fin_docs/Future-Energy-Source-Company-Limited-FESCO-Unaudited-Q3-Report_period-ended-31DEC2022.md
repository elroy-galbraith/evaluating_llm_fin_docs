A look ahead

FESCO continues to monitor the inflationary forces within the economy, such as interest rate increases and nearly full employment in many parishes among other factors. These affect private and/or consumer consumption as well as our allocation of investments. The Company must also navigate industry-related margin contractionary forces and potential consolidation within the industry.

This period will see the implementation of lasting structures and innovative tools which will increase the demand for our goods and services in the medium term. Additionally, the Company will be increasing the depth and breadth of our human resources as we prepare for the launch of our LPG offerings.

The Company will continue to make investments in real assets and equipment to support the expansion of the service station businesses, the industrial client business, as well as the promised entry into the LPG industry.
