Fellow Shareholders,

Eppley produced earnings per share of $0.48 in the first quarter of 2022, a 15% return for shareholders.¹

Proprietary Investment Portfolio
At the end of the year, we owned a $5.3 billion investment portfolio consisting of cash, loans, leases, receivables and investments in our mezzanine, real estate, infrastructure and asset management joint ventures and subsidiaries. The average income yield of our portfolio was 14% and 15% excluding our cash balances.

Asset Management Business
In addition to our investments, we manage or administer over US$100 million of capital in the Eppley Caribbean Property Fund, Caribbean Mezzanine Fund and other vehicles.

Capitalization and Liquidity
Our leverage was 4.2x our capital at the end of the first quarter and our average cost of debt was 6%. We ended the first quarter with over $449.0 million of cash.

Financial Performance
Our profit after tax for the first three months of 2022 was $91.6 million or 80% ahead of our earnings in the same period last year.

This growth in profitability was driven by a resurgence in our net interest income. We’ve deployed significant amounts of cash

into our proprietary investments in recent quarters led by the growth of our leasing business. As a result, net interest income in our most recent quarter was over 2.5x its level during the same period last year.

Net interest income continues to be complemented by the recurring, predictable fees we earn managing or administering assets in our real estate, mezzanine and infrastructure strategies.

Dividend
Today the Board of Directors approved a dividend of 5.2 cents per share payable on June 17, 2022, to ordinary shareholders on record as of May 31, 2022. This represents a 40% increase in Eppley’s longstanding interim quarterly dividend and reflects the Board’s assessment of our increased profitability.

Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, we expect to maintain our dividend policy in future periods.

Outlook
As interest rates rise in response to inflation, we expect Eppley’s net interest income margins to widen. As credit conditions tighten, we also expect Eppley to originate more attractive risk adjusted returns in our credit, mezzanine, infrastructure and real estate strategies.

Sincerely,

P.B. Scott
Chairman

Nicholas A. Scott
Vice Chairman
