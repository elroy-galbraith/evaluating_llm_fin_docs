DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT
UNAUDITED Q3 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

276% INCREASE IN PROFIT BEFORE TAX
$695.6m 3RD QUARTER REVENUE

Financial Performance

Berger Paints Jamaica Limited (BPJL) recorded revenue of $695.6M for the quarter ending September 30, 2021. This represents a 21% increase over the corresponding quarter in 2020 and is indicative of the market’s continued confidence in the Berger brand, and the response to our rebranding focus.

The local market and global economy remain unpredictable, due to the rippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and BPJL has been significantly impacted due to the present supply chain challenges being encountered worldwide. This has resulted in increased costs for Raw Materials/Consumables. Throughout 2021, this remained a constant threat as BPJL continued to grapple with frequent and significant Raw Material price increases and supply issues. Coupled with the increase in sales, Costs of Goods sold for Quarter 3 (Q3) 2021 totaled $337M, an increase of $73M or 28% above the $264M recorded in the comparative prior quarter.

Manufacturing and Operating Expenses for the quarter totaled $354.3M or 36% above the $260M for the corresponding quarter last year. To support 2021’s revenue growth, we have improved and increased our production output. Q3 2021 saw a 5% increase in production over the corresponding quarter and incurred additional costs in manufacturing expenses.

Other Operating Expense variances over Q3 2020 are mainly attributed to the investment in our re-branding and marketing programme, significant reversals to Accounts Receivables and Inventory Provisions achieved in 2020. In addition, increased foreign exchange volatility has been further heightened by the pandemic challenges.

With the increase in production, and continued investment geared to driving revenue growth, all while balancing the impact of the global challenges thus far, BPJL recorded Profit Before Tax (PBT) of $36.7M for the quarter, 36% below, the PBT of $57.6M recorded for the corresponding period in 2020. However, despite the impact of Operating Expenses on the third quarter in 2021, BPJL’s performance continues to trend positively and for the nine months ending September 30, 2021, have delivered $46.9M in PBT or 276% higher than the -$26.6M for the corresponding period in 2020.

A strong Statement of Financial Position supports our growth agenda and BPJL remains liquid with a healthy cash balance of $122M as at the end of the reporting quarter.

Outlook

2021 continues to be a challenging year. However, the BPJL team remains focused and committed to improving delivery of its products and services. Our BOLDLY BERGER campaign continues to instill colour and excitement in the market and as we approach our peak period, we look forward to working with all stakeholders and serving the needs of all our customers.

We extend our thanks to you our shareholders for your continued confidence and express a heartfelt thank you to our employees and valued customers for their ongoing support.

On behalf of the Board

Adam N. Sabga
Chairman
