Financial Results
For The Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022
Net Profit of $18.6 billion (attributable to stockholders of the parent)

Group Performance
A strong performance for the second consecutive quarter has contributed to net operating income of $105.6 billion for the nine months of the financial year, an increase of 15% or $13.8 billion over the prior year. The improvement in net operating income was largely driven by increased net revenues from the consumer & small and medium sized enterprises (SME), life & health insurance, treasury and payment services segments.

The improved revenues contributed to a general improvement in our key performance indicators over the prior year. Return on assets and return on equity improved to 1.75% up from 1.01% and 16.14% up from 8.45%, respectively. The cost to income ratio also improved to 71.87% down from 76.12% in the prior year, mainly due to revenue growth outpacing the growth in operating expenses.

Banking and Investment Activities
The net result from banking and investment activities of $80.1 billion represented an improvement of 9% or $6.4 billion over the prior year. Net interest income was the main contributor to the increase registering $48.6 billion, up $7.3 billion or 18%. Interest income from securities increased by 12% or $3.4 billion and interest from loans increased by 10% or $3.1 billion. The growth in average earning assets accounted for approximately 70% of the increase with the balance due to a 16 basis points increase in average yields.

Net fee and commission income increased by 14% or $2.3 billion to $19.1 billion. This improvement was primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our payment services segment. This increased credit card usage also resulted in increased rebates paid to customers. Other income increased by $1.3 billion due to one-off gains related to the sale of properties associated with our main Jamaican banking subsidiary’s branch optimisation and consolidation project.

Insurance Activities
The net result from insurance activities increased over the prior year by 41% or $7.4 billion to $25.5 billion, mainly due to strong performance from our life and health insurance segment as a result of improved net premium income.

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses totalled $77.2 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion or 8% over the prior year. There was a 9% rise in staff costs due to annual increases. Professional and consultancy fees increased by 25% as we continue to invest in expanding our digital capabilities. Property expenses, maintenance and utilities increased by 19% due to general price increases and credit card rebates paid to customers grew by 67%, consistent with the transaction volume increases in the payment services segment.

Net Profit of $18.6 billion (attributable to stockholders of the parent)

Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
At June 2022 total assets had increased to $2.02 trillion, up 7% from $1.89 trillion in the prior year. Growth in assets was mainly due to increased net loans, investment securities, amounts due from banks, and cash in hand and balances at central banks. The year over year growth was primarily funded by increased deposits, repurchase agreements, other borrowed funds, and liabilities under annuity and insurance contracts.

Investment Securities and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Investment securities, including pledged assets and reverse repurchase agreements, totalled $938.2 billion, an increase of 3% or $31.2 billion over the prior year. This continues to be the Group’s largest earning asset portfolio.

Loans and Advances
The Group’s loans and advances, net of credit impairment losses, totalled $558.7 billion, an increase of 11% or $54.7 billion over the prior year. Non-performing loans totalled $30.4 billion as at June 30, 2022, a decrease of $422 million or 1% from the prior year. Non-performing loans as a percentage of gross loans declined to 5.3%, down from 6.0% in the prior year.

Deposits
Deposits totalled $712.2 billion, an increase of 11% or $71.2 billion over the prior year, reflecting our banking customers’ confidence in the Group. This continues to be our largest source of funding.

Policyholders’ Liabilities
Liabilities under annuity and insurance contracts increased to $443.9 billion, up $9.2 billion or 2% over the prior year, reflecting continued growth in all our markets.

Capital and Liquidity
Equity attributable to stockholders of the parent totalled $146.6 billion, a decrease of $9.8 billion or 6% compared to the prior year. The decline was mainly attributable to a $35.1 billion decline in fair value reserves as a result of unrealised mark to market losses in the investment portfolio due to the rise in interest rates. This was partially offset by increased retained earnings due to improved profitability.

All our regulated entities continue to meet the applicable capital and liquidity regulatory requirements.

Dividends
The Board of Directors, at its meeting on August 4, 2022, did not decide to pay an interim dividend.

4. Macro-environment update

While the risks from the COVID-19 pandemic have receded, forecasts for global growth are being revised downwards as the downside risks from inflation and higher interest rates have intensified. Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank¹ have again cut their global growth outlook for 2022 and 2023 in July, warning that the world economy may soon be on the cusp of an outright recession. Global economic expansion is expected to slow to 3.2% this year, less than the 3.6% forecast by the IMF in April and the 4.4% estimated in January. Among the challenges to the global growth outlook are soaring inflation, a worse-than-expected slowdown in China, and the ongoing fallout from the war in Ukraine. These issues, along with lower-than-expected US consumer spending, have already caused US output and global output to contract in the second quarter of this year². Though headwinds have intensified fears of recession, there are counterbalancing positives that may help to sustain growth, though at a slower pace. Global growth is being supported by sustained vaccination, greater economic reopening, rising employment and consumption growth, though subdued.

The Latin America and Caribbean region is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2022 (World Bank), down from a 6.9% rebound in 2021. Most tourism-dependent countries such as Jamaica, Barbados, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands are continuing the recovery which started last year. Economic activity is also expected to remain strong for the rest of the year³, supported by greater tourist activity and the impact of base effects. Data available from United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) indicate that global international tourist arrivals more than doubled (+182%) in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021. Following the extended lockdowns, leisure travel⁴ and reconnecting with family and friends, continue to support the sector. These developments are driving a faster recovery in demand, fuelling investments in the tourism sector across the Caribbean and providing tailwinds to economic growth. All of our operating territories are expected to see growth in real GDP in 2022, with Barbados expected to experience the fastest growth rate of 11.0% supported by a rebound in tourism activity. This will bolster employment and household spending and help drive growth in private consumption. These same factors are expected to fuel growth in Jamaica allowing the country to produce a growth rate of 2.5% (IMF) in 2022. On the other hand, Trinidad and Tobago is expecting to see Real GDP grow by 3.8% in 2022, underpinned by sustained high oil and natural gas prices and improvements in the labour market. That being said, rising travel costs and inflation pose downside risks to the tourism sector. Furthermore, emerging market central banks have been raising interest rates to combat inflation, and growth in key markets is projected to slow this year. While the Bank of Jamaica is the only central bank within our operating territories that has raised rates, Barbados and Trinidad could follow suit in coming quarters to prevent capital flight and preserve their currencies as the Federal Reserve engages in more aggressive monetary policy tightening⁵.

1. The World Bank revised its growth forecast from 4.1% to 2.9%.
2. US GDP decreased by 0.5% in Q2 2022.
3. The IMF forecasts that Jamaica, and Barbados will grow by 2.5%, and 11.2%, respectively. The Bermudian Government expects the sovereign to grow between 2.5% to 4.5%, while Cayman is expected to grow by 4.0%.
4. In June, 63.8% of travellers said leisure travel was for them a "high" or "extremely high" budgetary item. This figure has remained stable over the first six months of 2022. Maximum expected annual travel budgets grew in June, reaching an average of US$4,345, an increase of 10.2% over May (Destination Analysts, 2022).
5. The Fed raised its policy rate by 75bps on July 27, 2022 now the rate is between 2.25%-2.5%.

4. Macro-environment update (continued)

Although our operating environments face similar risks to the global economy, such as rising inflation and interest rates, the prospects for growth this year remain positive with the more widespread economic reopening. The banking sector is expected to realise higher net interest and higher fee and commission income. However, higher interest rates could cause loan demand to slow as it may be a deterrent to some borrowers because it makes debt more expensive. The current rising interest rate environment should reduce life insurers’ assets and liabilities, but the net effect is expected to be positive as the impact on the value of liabilities is expected to be greater. Securities dealers will face risks to their profitability as rising interest rates reduce the value of bonds and other fixed-income assets, and lower spreads as liabilities reprice faster than asset yields. However, given their ability to hedge against inflation, the demand for new alternative investment products should also grow, helping to drive fee and commission income. Additionally, the sector should benefit from increased IPOs, APOs, cross-listings on the JSE, and improvements in corporate earnings as sectors continue to recover supporting investor confidence. However, the size of these transactions will be constrained by lower JMD liquidity, as BOJ uses it as a tool to stem inflation. Though there are fresh headwinds, the Group will continue to take advantage of emerging opportunities, while trying to mitigate the existing and emerging risks.
