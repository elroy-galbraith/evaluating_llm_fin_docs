Directors’ Report

The Board of Directors presents the unaudited financial statements for the second quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Revenue for the quarter increased by $30.0M from $147.5M the prior year to $177.5M. Despite this increase, the company incurred a net loss for the quarter of $7.3M compared to a profit of $7.2M over the corresponding period in the prior year, which was a decline of 201%.

We continue to be negatively affected by the extended downtime of major revenue-earning machines during the quarter under review. This translated to a loss of revenue in excess of $40.0M during the quarter. A significant increase in the depreciation expense now being booked for the new MRI purchased last year, also contributed to the loss for the quarter.

With the recent overhaul of two of our more problematic machines which are no longer under warranty, and additional planned preventative maintenance exercises, we do not expect extraordinary downtime going forward.

A new CT machine is being installed at our Liguanea location and will be commissioned into service by March 1, 2023 and this will provide a redundancy for future downtime of the other unit located at our New Kingston location.

Total Assets were $1,047.1M compared to $778.0M for the corresponding period in the prior year, and Total Liabilities were $577.1M compared to $336.0M for the comparative period.
The acquisition of the Siemens MRI which was fully reflected on our books after it was commissioned in July 2022, and down-payments made on the new CT machine in December 2022 resulted in the significant variance reflected in the total assets figures reported between the comparative periods.

A new arrangement is being negotiated which will enable a significant reduction in our direct costs during the ensuing quarters at our two Kingston locations, in keeping with similar measures introduced last year at our Drax Hall location.

Despite increased competition from other industry players, the demand for our services continues to be very high, and increased marketing has gradually improved our brand within the market place allowing us to remain confident in our growth projections.

We thank our loyal customers, the referring physicians and specialists with whom we partner, all our shareholders, and the dedicated Elite team for their continued hard work and support.
