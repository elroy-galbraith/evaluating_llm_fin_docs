EVERYTHING FRESH

COMPANY AND ITS HISTORY

Everything Fresh Limited was incorporated on August 18th, 2003, commencing operations some five years later in October of 2008. The Company imports and manufactures high-demand food products to include dairy products, assorted dry and canned goods, fruits, vegetables, seafood and delicatessen meats and distributes them to various blue-chip companies and businesses in Jamaica across the hospitality and food retail sectors.

History of the Business

The Company was built on the backbone of the success experienced by one of the Company’s founding Director’s and Shareholder’s Mr. Courtney Pullen, who, as a sole trader commenced his business in 1996 selling local farm produce to the local supermarkets. After three years of purchasing produce and dabbling in farming himself, he extended his sights offshore and began importing fruits and vegetables from the United States of America through an importer in Jamaica. The sales of imported produce proved to be much more profitable than the sale of local produce and this rapid growth in business led Mr. Pullen to incorporate a company by the name of C.L. Pullen Limited (“CLP Limited”) in March 2003 under whose umbrella such importation and sale would take place.

CLP Limited grew at a rapid rate, doubling in size over the first four years of trading and thereafter experiencing growth of approximately 25 to 30 percent in each subsequent year, when compared to the previous year’s performance. With their sights set on onward and upward growth, the directorship made the decision to expand the breadth of their offering. With this goal of expansion in mind, the Company, Everything Fresh Limited, commenced operations in October 2008 with the intent of enhancing sales in new lines of products such as dairy and dry food.

Commencement of Operations of Everything Fresh Limited

The Company’s introduction to the local market was met with positive feedback and increased revenues to match. This led the Company’s Directors to make a strategic decision to expand its range of product inventory beyond fruits and vegetables to dairy products, delicatessen meats, assorted dry and canned goods to local supermarkets. Following a resounding success with the introduction of this new selection of products, the Company experienced sales in the four-month period of January to April of 2009 just south of a 200% increase in revenue over the period. The Company’s Directors acknowledged this as the path to building the business and growing the Company and in June 2009 all trade under the company name C.L. Pullen ceased. The Company has grown from strength to strength in the years since.

Further Growth of the Business

Two of the Company’s founding members and Directors, Mr. Courtney Pullen and Mrs. Melene Pullen identified the potential to further reduce the importation costs, and set out to incorporate a company based in Miami, Florida which would buy directly from manufacturers and sell to the Company at marginal mark-up. The said company was incorporated under the name Quality Produce and Groceries Inc. and ushered in a new phase of growth by increasing the Company’s bottom line and making the price of the Company’s products more competitive and therefore more attractive to their customers. The Company was able to enter the food service market by increasing its client base from supermarkets only to now include supplying hotels. This increased the Company’s market share by approximately five hundred per cent (500%).

At the start of 2012, an opening was created in the local market by the closure of National Meats Company and the RIU Hotels requested that the Company import meats for them. The Company purchased two (2) Freightliner trucks and built three additional freezer rooms at its current registered location, 78 Marcus Garvey Drive, Kingston 11 and in July 2012 the Company started to supply beef, poultry and seafood to hotels.

With a new goal diversifying their methods of sourcing products for their customers, the Company successfully acquired The Meat Experts, based in Bog Walk, St. Catherine, in January 2019. The acquisition provided access to increased cold storage and lowered expenses through shared back office operations which include management, administration, logistics, sales team and more which enables the Company to manufacture goods locally.

The Company’s Success

Everything Fresh Limited prides itself not only on procuring quality goods for distribution to its customers but goes above and beyond most of its competitors to live up to its name which quite simply means that everything, every product or good, is delivered fresh. Further, the Company has had and continues to have a very good relationship with its suppliers and customers as a result of the professionalism of its team and the expeditious delivery of all its fresh goods and products to its growing customer base. The Directors believe that the Company is providing its customers with an unparalleled level of courteous service.

The Company prides itself on having a ‘family-like’ corporate culture, which is evidenced by the high-retention rate of its Team, with over seventy-five per cent of Team members having been employed to the company from commencement of its operations in 2008 and the remainder having been employed to the Company for over five to seven years. In the true meaning of family, no one member plays the single role but wears any hat required by the Company on a day-to-day basis to ensure the smooth running of the operation, greatly contributing to the success of the business.

Throughout 2021, operating a business while continuing to face the challenges brought by Covid-19, was like being in a boxing ring with an invisible assailant. We stayed agile, shifted our approach, and remained positive. Ultimately, we took a few blows but were never down for the count. Our financial results are testament to the resilience and determination of the entire team at Everything Fresh.

Together, we strategized to manage costs and displayed creativity in diversifying our business to cater to new segments. The result was a 54% increase in revenue which registered $1.6 billion for 2021 versus $1.1 billion in 2020. We also significantly reduced our losses to $33.5 million from $181.1 million the previous year. For this I am tremendously grateful to our dedicated employees who kept our business viable and in fighting form.

A Nimble and Focused Approach

Our first priority was to focus on our people. We retained all our staff except for those that were employed to the meat factory which was closed during the year. We maintained strict health and safety protocols to enable us to remain fully operational, and provided strong, people-centred leadership amidst the ongoing uncertainty as the virus continued to mutate.

With the delayed reopening of the tourism sector, we restructured the business, expanding in the retail trade to compensate for the gap in sales from hotels. Supermarkets, restaurants, and hotels provided the majority of sales which gradually started to trend upwards in March 2021.

We steadily increased our sales and distribution capacity and deployed more merchandisers at supermarkets. We targeted existing supermarkets and successfully outstripped competitors by offering better availability, new product lines, and superior purchasing and stocking. We also decided to formalise sales representatives who were existing employees, to became commission-based and incentivised.

Prior to Covid, Everything Fresh sourced between 12 to 14 percent of our business from the retail sector, we started growing this in 2020 and continued throughout 2021 to reach 40 per cent. We ended the year recording an overall 39 percent increase in sales to supermarkets, the fastest growing segment of the business. This was an intentional strategy designed to increase resilience of the business to operate without the hotel sector for a sustained period and generate steady revenue.

Outlook for 2022

The last two years are testament to the fact that change is the only constant. Everything Fresh has proven to be nimble and focused in adjusting our strategies, and continually charting a way forward.

We will continue to seek out opportunities, anticipate trends and introduce new product lines to meet consumer demand. We are approaching the target we set for the business to have a near 50:50 split of institutional and retail sales to eliminate overreliance on any one segment. We have built up significant expertise in the retail trade and we expect this will continue to grow as we increase our merchandising expertise and inventory management.

Notably, Everything Fresh Bahamas became more profitable in 2021. There is still huge untapped potential in that market so we will place concentrated efforts on getting Everything Fresh Bahamas up to full capacity and maximise growth in 2022.

The Jamaican economy ended 2021 in much better shape, registering growth of 4.7%, which is forecasted to continue in 2022. The Tourism industry is on an upswing and travel predictions for the coming year are robust.

Our business is already on the right path and the revival of the hotel sector and restaurant business is paving the way towards full recovery for Everything Fresh – both Jamaica and Bahamas.

I wish to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership and support, and our employees for their dedication. We remain upbeat and committed to deliver sustainable growth and a return to profit that will benefit our shareholders, our people and the communities in which we operate.

The last two years are testament to the fact that change is the only constant. Everything Fresh has proven to be nimble and focused in adjusting our strategies, and continually charting a way forward.

Management Discussion & Analysis

Everything Fresh Limited successfully braved the challenges of 2021 and delivered a strong performance to recover lost ground and clear the way for a return to pre-pandemic profit levels in the coming year.

The disruption brought by Covid-19 continued into 2021 with lockdowns and restrictions to the hospitality sector. This severely impacted the activities of the Company which are primarily the importation and distribution of dairy products, meats, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and dry goods destined for institutional sales, primarily hotels.

Strategy

In response, Everything Fresh continued to aggressively pursue a retail strategy targeting supermarkets, restaurants and wholesales. The Company leveraged Sage 300, the accounting tool acquired in 2019, to improve inventory management, and placed additional merchandisers in supermarkets. Investing in new tablets afforded the sales team higher visibility of stock levels and the ability to work in a more structured way with merchandising. Better availability, purchasing, and stocking gave the Company a competitive edge.

The Everything Fresh team harnessed its creativity and added new product lines to meet consumer demands. When the food service market declined, the Company seized the opportunity to reposition unbranded flour wraps originally destined for hotel sales and introduced the Provecho line of flour wraps in various flavours including spinach and tomato basil. Similarly, the Company continued supermarket sales of bulk fruit in 2-pound packs under the EVERYTHING FRESH label. Both of these performed very well in the retail market.

Pre-covid, the hotel industry contributed 85% of total sales. In 2021, this figure was more balanced with hotels at 60% and retail having grown to 40%, up from 12 –14% in prior years. Everything Fresh started delivering to wholesales and doubled the restaurant business. As retail sales expanded, margins also improved versus 2020 when there was deep discounting to reduce stock levels.

On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of 60% of the shares of Everything Fresh Bahamas and began consolidating the results into its financial statements going forward. Market conditions in the Bahamas were similar to Jamaica with tourism earnings declining due to the Covid lockdowns. However, many of the hotels and restaurants in Bahamas remained open so the business was not as badly affected by restrictions. At the close of the year, Everything Fresh Bahamas emerged as the Company’s sole profitable segment.

Revenue

Despite the continued disruption in the operating environment, the Company grew revenue to $1.6 billion at the close of year ending December 2021, a 54% increase over the previous year’s figure of $1.1 billion. Along with the increase in revenue, Gross profit grew over 140% to $343.4 million from $142.8 million in 2020.

The Company saw its steepest rate of decline in revenue at the beginning of the year. Sales began to rebound in March and April, followed by significant growth in May and June, as increased hotel occupancy levels had a positive impact on sales to the sector.

Sales to the retail sector continued on a positive trend in the final quarter of 2021 and the Company registered a strong performance in December to close the financial year.

Management Discussion & Analysis

Operating Expenses

Expenses
The Company held tight on expenses, which rose to $353.6 million from $293.5 million a year earlier, or 20% more over the period. The increase in the expenses is largely attributable to the consolidation of the expenses of the Bahamian subsidiary in 2021 as compared to only the Jamaican parent in 2020.

At the end of April 2021, Everything Fresh ceased production of meat products at the plant in Bog Walk, St. Catherine. This yielded a significant reduction in expenses for the balance of the year and served to improve the profitability of the Company.

Total Liabilities

![Bar chart showing Total Liabilities from 2013 to 2021](page_184_770_1096_355.png)

Net Loss
With the disciplined approach to managing costs and driving increased revenue from the retail sector which carries a higher margin, the Company was able to minimise net loss to $33.5 million, a significant improvement over the $181.1 million in 2020. This equated to a loss of 4 cents per stock unit in 2021 compared to a loss of 23 cents in 2020.

The Bahamas trading division recorded steady profits of $14.8 million in the seven-month period ended December 31, 2021.

The Jamaican trading division closed the year with losses of $15.9 million, down from $128 million a year earlier, while losses from the meat plant were down to $26 million from $49.7 million a year earlier.

Balance sheet position
As hotels reopened and occupancy rose, there was a corresponding increase in receivables from $163.7 million to $260.4 million.

The company restored assets up $947.2 million in 2021 from $754.4 million in 2020. This was accompanied by an increase in liabilities during the year, in particular on borrowings and payables, which resulted in a decline in total equity to $325.1 million from $358.6 million.

With retail sales increasing and the business rebounding, inventory rose to $307.8 million up from $258.2 in 2020.

Cash
The Company ended 2021 in a stronger cash position at $60.2 million versus $27.5 million in 2022. This was partly due to closure of the Bog Walk meat plant, as noted above. After ceasing production, the Company started gaining other income through clientele who required cold storage.

Outlook

The Tourism industry is stronger and will have a positive impact on volume as tourist arrivals increase and the hotel sector rebounds.

Our strategy to expand the retail arm of the business to reduce reliance on hotels has been delivering excellent results. We will therefore continue to grow in supermarkets and restaurants, introducing new product lines and anticipating consumer trends.

The structure we implemented in 2020, with our sales and merchandising teams, is poised to reap even greater benefits in 2022. We intend to generate volume and gross profit growth, without adding fixed costs, through monitoring expenses and reengineering processes to become more efficient.

We will also direct more efforts into marketing and promotion, with radio advertising, building a stronger presence on social channels such as Instagram and Facebook and boosting our presence in supermarkets with taste-testing.

As a family-oriented business, we are passionate about giving back to the community and we are committed to increasing our corporate social responsibility activities in 2022.

In summary, the business is on an upward trajectory as we climb out of Covid. We are on a clear path to recovery and our outlook for the future is positive. There is significant growth potential to explore in the Bahamas, the margins we make in Jamaica will continue to improve, and a return to profitability is within grasp. We will continue investing in our people and in our community as we strive to deliver value to our shareholders.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of Everything Fresh Limited

Report on the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Everything Fresh Limited set out on pages 8 to 61, which comprise the group and the company's statements of financial position at 31 December 2021, and the group and the company’s statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the company as at 31 December 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter - Impact of COVID-19

We draw attention to note 31 in which is disclosed the strategies which management has adopted to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of the group.

Management is of the view that the strategies which have been implemented will overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

  <tr>
    <td><i>Expected credit losses on trade receivables</i><br>
    See notes 3 (m)(iv) and 5 (c)(ii) to the financial statements for management’s disclosures of related accounting policies<br>
    As at 31 December 2021, trade receivables, net of provision for credit losses amounted to $254 million or 27% of total assets of the group. An impairment provision of $3.4 million has been recognized by the group.<br>
    The adequacy of the provision for credit losses on the group’s trade receivables involves a high degree of estimation and judgement. The group estimates expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience.<br>
    Customers were placed in aging buckets and a default risk percentage calculated using the incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts, the credit history, risk profile of each customer and the aging of receivables.<br>
    The estimates involve increased judgment as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19.<br>
    Management considered the following:<br>
    1. Qualitative factors that create COVID-19 related changes to significant increase in credit risk (SICR); and<br>
    2. Increased uncertainty about potential future economic scenarios and their impact on credit losses.
    </td>
    <td>The group’s accounting policy as it relates to the impairment provision for trade receivables was obtained and the reasonableness of the accounting policy assessed in relation to the requirements of the relevant standard.<br>
    This was achieved by:
    <ol>
      <li>We established an understanding of management’s ECL model including source data, the effectiveness of the implementation and the mathematical accuracy of the model. We tested the reliability of the source data used in the design of the model by confirming a sample to the historical data.</li>
      <li>We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and judgement in arriving at the forward looking multiple, by assessing the basis of the multiple economic scenarios used and the weighting assigned by management. The main macro factors used were compared to external public information, particularly as it relates to the impact of COVID-19 and calculations tested through recomputation.</li>
      <li>We determined whether the default risk percentage was accurately calculated and correctly applied to the relevant buckets of accounts receivable.</li>

      A significant portion of the foreign purchases are made from a related party and as such these transactions could present a risk if not conducted at arm’s length.</td>
    <td>Our audit procedures included the following:<br>
      1. We verified that the transactions were approved in accordance with internal procedures including involvement of key personnel at the appropriate level;<br>
      2. We verified a sample of the purchases from the related party to determine that the transactions were made at reasonable market prices.</td>

    <td><i>Impairment Assessment of Goodwill</i><br>
      See notes 3(e), 4 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements<br>
      The carrying value of the group’s goodwill may not be recoverable due to changes in the business and economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. These factors create inherent uncertainty in forecasting and require significant judgement in estimating and discounting future cash flows that support the assessment of recoverability.<br>
      Management determined the recoverable amount by reference to value-in-use which is based on discounted cash flow projections over which management makes significant judgements on key inputs. As a result of the assessment, management determined there was no impairment as at 31 December 2021.<br>
      We focused on this area as the goodwill impairment assessment requires significant management judgement and estimation, is sensitive to changes in key assumptions and due to the challenges involved in determining the impact of COVID-19 on those key assumptions.</td>
    <td>Management’s impairment assessment was tested by performing the following procedures, amongst others:<br>
      1. We obtained management’s discounted cash flow model (DCF) including qualitative and quantitative analyses and obtained an understanding of the process used by management to determine the value in use of each cash generating unit (CGU).<br>
      2. We compared management’s assumptions to externally derived data as well as our own assessments of key inputs, such as projected economic growth (including the impact of COVID-19), competition, cost inflation and discount rates, as well as performing sensitivity analysis on the assumptions.<br>
      3. We tested management’s impairment testing model calculations for mathematical accuracy.<br>
      Based on the audit procedures performed, no adjustments were made to the financial statements.</td>

Refer to notes 3(b),16 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of related accounting policies and balances.<br>
On 1 June 2021 the company acquired 60% of the shareholding of Everything Fresh Bahamas Limited. Management assessed that the acquisition qualified as a business combination resulting in recognition of goodwill in the amount of $85.1 million.<br>
We focused on this area due to the nature of business combinations, the accounting requirements of which can be complex and require management to exercise judgment in determining certain estimates.</td>
    <td>We evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting for the acquisition as a business combination and ensured it complied with management’s accounting policies and the applicable accounting standards.<br>
We held discussions with management to understand and evaluate their basis for determining assumptions. This included evaluating the appropriateness of valuation methodologies utilised to derive the fair value of identified intangible assets and evaluating the reasonableness of the underlying valuation assumptions and inputs.<br>
We recalculated the goodwill, being the difference between the total net consideration and the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired for mathematical accuracy.<br>

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

To the Members of
Everything Fresh Limited

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group and the company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that presents a true and fair view.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been kept, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act, in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Donna Hobson.

1. IDENTIFICATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES:

(a) Everything Fresh Limited ("the company") is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The registered office of the company is 78 Marcus Garvey Drive, Kingston 11. The company is listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

(b) The principal activities of the company are the importation and distribution of dairy products, meats, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dry goods as well as the manufacture of meat products from its Bog Walk location. The company ceased operations at the Bog Walk location during the year and the assets were transferred to the Marcus Garvey Drive location.

(c) On 1 June 2021, the company acquired 60% of the shareholdings of Everything Fresh Bahamas Limited, a company incorporated in Bahamas. The principal activities are the distribution of dairy products, meats, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dry goods.

The company and its subsidiary are referred to as "the Group".

2. REPORTING CURRENCY:

Items included in the financial statements of the group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates ('the functional currency'). These financial statements are presented in Jamaican dollars, which is considered the group’s functional and presentation currency, unless otherwise stated.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

(a) Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), and have been prepared under the historical cost convention. They are also prepared in accordance with requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and action, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.

(a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)

New, revised and amended standards and interpretations that became effective during the year

Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that became effective during the current financial year. The group has assessed the relevance of all such new standards, interpretations and amendments and has concluded that the following amendments are relevant to its operations:

Amendment to IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent concessions have been granted to lessees. This amendment provides lessees with an option to treat qualifying rent concessions in the same way as they would if they were not lease modifications. The adoption of this amendment did not have a significant impact on the group.

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted

The following amendments to standards which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the group’s future financial statements:

Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023). These amendments clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current depending on the rights that exists at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (for example, the receipt of a waiver or breach of covenant). The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. The adoption of these amendments is not expected to have a significant impact on the group.

Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). This amendment prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. It also clarifies that an entity is ‘testing whether the asset is functioning properly’ when it assesses the technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset is not relevant to this assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the group.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted (cont’d)

The following amendments to standards which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the group’s future financial statements (cont’d):

Amendment to IAS 37, ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). This amendment clarifies that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts. Before recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the group.

Amendment to IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). This amendment updates the references to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and adds an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ and Interpretation 21, ‘Levies’. The amendment also confirms that contingent assets should not be recognised at the acquisition date. The group will apply this amendment to future business combinations.

Annual Improvements 2018-2020, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). The IASB issued its Accounting Improvements to IFRSs 2018-2020 cycle amending a number of standards, of which the following are relevant to the company: IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ to clarify the fees that should be included in the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities; IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, in which illustrative example 13 was amended to remove the reimbursement of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements, to remove any confusion about the treatment of lease incentives.

(b) Basis of consolidation

Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiary (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are initially recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.

*End of Page 55*

### Page 56

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(b) Basis of consolidation (cont’d)

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss.

The group uses the audited financial statements of its subsidiary, Everything Fresh Bahamas Limited at 31 December 2021 for the purpose of consolidation.

(c) Foreign currency translation

Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated to Jamaican dollars using the closing rate as at the reporting date.

Exchange differences arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the dates of the transactions and unrealized foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in profit or loss.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

### Page 57

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(d) Property, plant and equipment (cont’d)

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis at such rates as will write off the carrying value of the assets over the period of their expected useful lives. The expected useful lives are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Warehouse improvements</th>
    <td>10 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Fixtures and equipment</th>
    <td>10 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Motor vehicles</th>
    <td>8 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cold storage rooms</th>
    <td>10 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts and are taken into account in determining profit or loss.

(e) Intangible assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded at cost and represents the excess of the value of consideration paid over the group’s interest in net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill is tested at the end of each reporting period for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.

Computer software

Computer software, is deemed to have a finite useful life of five years and is measured at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Brand

Brand is recorded at cost and represents the value of the consideration paid to acquire a well established and recognised meat brand. The cost is amortised over the estimated useful life of the brand, which is three years.

(f) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Fair value less costs to sell is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(g) Right-of-use asset

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at an amount equal to the initial value of the lease obligation which is subsequently adjusted for the following items:

i) Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;

ii) Any initial direct costs incurred by the group;

iii) An estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the site on which the asset is located.

For short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and low-value assets, the group has elected to not recognize a lease obligation and right-of-use asset and instead will recognize a lease expense as permitted under IFRS 16.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the date of adoption to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or end of the lease term.

Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, which replaces the previous requirement to recognize a provision for onerous lease contracts under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

(h) Leases

Leases are accounted for by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for leases of low value assets and leases with a term of 12 months or less.

The lease obligation is measured at the present value of the contractual obligation, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease term, unless that rate is not readily determinable, in which case the group will use its incremental borrowing rate.

The lease term determined by the group comprises:

i) The non-cancelable period of lease contracts, including a rent-free period if applicable;

ii) Periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

iii) Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.

*End of Page 58*

### Page 59

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(h) Leases (cont’d)

The commencement date of the lease begins on the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use to the group. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease obligation are comprised of the following:

i) Fixed lease payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

ii) Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;

iii) Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;

iv) The exercise price of purchase options that the group is reasonably certain to exercise;

v) Lease payments in an option renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option;

vi) Penalties for early termination of the lease unless the group is reasonably certain not to terminate early; and

vii) Less any incentive receivable.

Variable payments for leases that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease obligations. The variable payments are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Having elected to do so, the group accounts for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement, which is permitted under IFRS 16.

Interest on the lease obligations is calculated using the effective interest method and increases the lease obligation while rent payments reduce the obligation. The lease obligation is re-measured whenever a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, or there is a change in the assessment of the exercise of an extension option. The lease obligation is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset or is recorded in gain or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero or the modification results in a reduction in the scope of the lease. The revised carrying amount is amortised over the remaining lease term.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(i) Revenue recognition

Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised at a point in time in the amount of the price, before tax on sales, expected to be received by the group for goods supplied as a result of their ordinary activities, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled, and control of goods passes to the customer. Revenue is decreased by any trade discounts granted to customers.

For contracts that permit return of goods, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

The right to recover returned goods is measured at the former carrying amount of inventory less any expected cost to recover.

Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The “effective interest rate” is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instruments to its gross carrying amount.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments, the group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL.

(j) Impairment of non-current assets

Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the greater of an asset’s net selling price and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identified cash flows. Non financial assets, except goodwill, that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

*End of Page 60*

### Page 61

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(k) Current and deferred income taxes

Taxation expense in profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax charges.

Current tax charges are based on taxable profits for the year, which differ from the profit before tax reported because taxable profits exclude items that are taxable or deductible in other years, and items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated at tax rates that have been enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to be paid or recovered on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax bases. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except where it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity.

(l) Employee benefits

Defined contribution plan

The company operates a defined contribution pension plan which is funded by employees’ contribution of 5% -10% of salary and employer’s contribution of 5%. Once the contributions have been paid, the company has no further obligations. Contributions are charged to the statement of profit or loss, in the year to which they relate.

(m) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity in another entity.

Financial assets

(i) Recognition and derecognition

Financial assets are initially recognised on the settlement date, which is the date that an asset is delivered to the group. This includes regular purchases of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

*End of Page 61*

### Page 62

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(m) Financial instruments (cont’d)

Financial assets (cont’d)

(i) Recognition and derecognition (cont’d)

The group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains all or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such de-recognised financial assets that is created or retained by the group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

(ii) Classification

The group classifies all of its financial instruments at initial recognition based on their contractual terms and the business model for managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value, except in the case of financial assets recorded at FVPL, transaction costs are added to, or subtracted from, this amount.

The group classifies its financial assets as those measured at amortised cost.

(iii) Measurement category

Amortised cost

These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (eg. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

The group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables, due from related parties and cash and short term deposit in the statement of financial position.

Cash and short term deposit includes cash at bank and in hand and short term deposit. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short term deposit with original maturity of three months or less and credit card balances. Credit card balances are shown within borrowings under current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(m) Financial instruments (cont’d)

Financial assets (cont’d)

(iv) Impairment

Impairment provisions for current and non-current trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses (ECL).

During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed by taking into consideration historical rates of default for each segment of trade receivables as well as the estimated impact of forward looking information. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime ECL for the trade receivables. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within the statement of profit or loss. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.

Impairment provisions for receivables from related parties and loans to related parties are recognised based on a forward-looking expected credit loss model. The methodology used to determine the amount of the provision is based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset. For those where the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve month expected credit losses along with gross interest income are recognised.

For those for which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised. For those that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.

Financial liabilities

The group’s financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. At the reporting date, the following items were classified as financial liabilities: trade and other payables, due to related party, borrowings and lease liabilities.

The group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

(n) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributed to the issue of ordinary shares are recognized as a deduction from equity.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(o) Dividend distribution

Dividend distribution to the group’s shareholders is recognized as a liability in the group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the group’s shareholders.

Dividends for the year that are declared after the reporting date are dealt with in the subsequent events note.

(p) Borrowings

Borrowings are recognized initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method. Any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.

(q) Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. Each operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The group has identified the Managing Director as its CODM.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES:

Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

(a) Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies

In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management has not made any judgements that it believes would cause a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.

(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

(i) Allowance for impairment losses on trade receivables

Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined upon origination of the trade receivable based on a model that calculates the expected credit loss (ECL) of the trade receivables.

(i) Allowance for impairment losses on trade receivables (cont’d)

Under this ECL model, the group segments its trade receivables in a matrix by days past due and determined for each age bracket an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience over the last 12 months and analysis of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the trade receivables.

The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the segment of 365 days or more past due. The use of assumptions make uncertainty inherent in such estimates.

(ii) Income taxes

Estimates are required in determining the provision for income tax. There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

(iii) Depreciable assets

Estimates of the useful life and the residual value of property, plant and equipment are required in order to apply an adequate rate of transferring the economic benefits embodied in these assets in the relevant periods. The group applies a variety of methods in an effort to arrive at these estimates from which actual results may vary. Actual variations in estimated useful lives and residual values are reflected in statement of income through impairment or adjusted depreciation provisions.

(iv) Net realizable value of inventories

Estimates of net realizable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realize. The estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.

Estimates of net realizable value also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held.

(v) Assessment of goodwill

The group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 3(e). The assessment of goodwill impairment involves the determination of the value in use. Determination of value in use involves the estimation of future cash flows from the business taking into consideration the growth rates, inflation rates and discount rate. Any changes in these variables would impact the value in use calculations.

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT:

The group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:

Credit risk
Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
Foreign exchange risk
Other market price, and
Liquidity risk

In common with all other businesses, the group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.

There have been no substantive changes in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.

(a) Principal financial instruments

The principal financial instruments used by the group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:

- Trade and other receivables
- Cash and short term deposit
- Trade and other payables
- Borrowings
- Due from/to related parties
- Lease liabilities

(c) Financial risk factors

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports from the Financial Controller through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:

(i) Market risk

Market risk arises from the group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).

Currency risk

Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Currency risk arises from transactions for sales, purchases and US dollar cash and bank balances. The group manages this risk by ensuring that the net exposure in foreign assets and liabilities is kept to an acceptable level by monitoring currency positions. The group further manages this risk by maximizing foreign currency earnings.

Foreign currency sensitivity

The following table indicates the sensitivity of loss before taxation to changes in foreign exchange rates. The change in currency rate below represents management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis represents outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables, cash and bank balances, borrowings, lease liabilities and payable balances, and adjusts their translation at the year-end for 8% (2020 - 6%) depreciation and a 2% (2020 - 2%) appreciation of the Jamaican dollar against the US dollar and Bahamian dollar. The changes below would have no impact on other components of equity.

Price risk

Price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The group is not exposed to market price fluctuations at the reporting date.

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT’D):

(c) Financial risk factors (cont’d)

(i) Market risk (cont’d)

Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

Floating rate instruments expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas fixed rate instruments expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.

The group is primarily exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its short term deposits and long term borrowings.

Short term deposits and borrowings are the only interest bearing assets and liabilities respectively, within the group. The group’s short term borrowings are due to mature within a year of the reporting date.

Interest rate sensitivity

There is no significant exposure to interest rate risk on short term deposits, as these deposits have a short term to maturity and are constantly reinvested at current market rates.

There is no significant exposure to interest rate risk on short term borrowings as these revolving loans are due to be repaid within 90 days of commencement.

A 3% increase/0.5% decrease (2020 - 1% increase/1% decrease) in interest rates on Jamaican long term borrowings and credit cards would result in a $4,645,000 increase and $774,000 decrease (2020 -$1,102,000 increase/decrease) in the operating results of the group.

(ii) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit risk arises from trade receivables, related company balances and cash and bank balances.

Maximum exposure to credit risk

The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of cash and short term deposit and trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position.

Cash and bank balances and short term deposit

Cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Trade receivables

Revenue transactions in respect of the group’s primary operations are done on a credit basis. The group has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.

Expected credit losses on trade receivables

The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are based on an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model. The guiding principle of the ECL model is to reflect the general pattern of deterioration or improvement in the credit quality of financial instruments.

For trade receivables and contract assets that do not have a financing component, it is a requirement of IFRS 9 to recognize a lifetime expected credit loss. This was achieved by the development and application of historical data relating to trade receivables and write-offs, as well as forecasting payment probabilities.

The group estimates expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience as well as the credit risk and expected developments for each group of customers. The following table provides information about the ECL’s for trade receivables as at 31 December.

Liquidity risk management process

The group’s liquidity risk management process, as carried out within the group and monitored by the Accounts Department, includes:

i) Monitoring future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis.
ii) Maintaining a portfolio of short term investment balances that can easily be liquidated as protection against any unforeseen interruption to cash flow.
iii) Maintaining committed lines of credit.
iv) Optimising cash returns on investments.

Cash flows of financial liabilities

The maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities, based on contractual undiscounted payments, is as follows:

(d) Capital management

The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for stockholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the group defines as net operating income, excluding non-recurring items, divided by total stockholders’ equity. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to stockholders.

There are no particular strategies to determine the optimal capital structure. There are also no external capital maintenance requirements to which the group is subject.

6. SEGMENT REPORTING:

The group has two reportable segments which are based on the different types of products that it offers. These products are described in its principal activities (note 1). The identification of business segments, is based on the management and internal reporting structure. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Information regarding results of each reportable segment is included below. The meat plant division was closed on 30 April 2021. Performance is measured on segment profit before taxation as included in the management reports. Segment profit before taxation is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

No deferred tax was recognised in the current period.

Goodwill -

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Everything Fresh Bahamas Limited and is largely attributable to synergies and economies of scale. This arose from years of creation and maintenance of solid customer base, good customer relations and general business operations.

Impairment tests for goodwill -

The group determines whether goodwill is impaired at the end of each reporting period or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. In testing goodwill for impairment, recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are estimated based on value-in-use. Where the recoverable amounts exceed the carrying amounts, no impairment allowance is made. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are arrived at by estimating their future cash flows and discounting those cash flows using long-term discount rates applicable to the group. Future sustainable cash flows are estimated based on the most recent forecasts, after taking account of past experience. In all cases projected cash flows are taken over five years, however as a consequence to the COVID-19 pandemic, the group used a seven year projection to make allowance for an additional two years of recovery. The long-term growth rate is applied following the immediately following year, within a terminal value calculated based on the discount rate and growth rate applied. Each cash generating unit is regarded as saleable to a third party at any future date at a price sufficient to recover its carrying amount of goodwill.

(d) Contractual undiscounted cash flows maturity analysis

The contractual undiscounted lease liability cash flows maturity analysis is disclosed under liquidity risk in the financial risk management note 5(c)(iii).

(e) Nature of leasing activities (in the capacity as lessees)

The company leases the property from which the head office operates (Marcus Garvey Drive) as well as the property from which the meat division operated. Although the meat division has ceased operations during the year, the company has continued with the lease and has repurposed the location. The lease contract of the Marcus Garvey Drive property provides for payments to increase each year by 7½% at the beginning of each year. The lease contract for the Bog Walk property provides for payments to increase by 10% after the first two years of the lease, which would thereafter remain in effect for the term of the lease.

18. DEFERRED TAX:

Deferred taxes are calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a principal tax rate of 25%.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities. The amounts determined after appropriate offsetting are as follows:

COVID-19 continued to have a negative impact on the Hotel Industry in 2021, both here in Jamaica and in the Bahamas.

In 2021, 60% of total sales of the company were derived from the hotel industry as compared to 46% in 2020. However, when comparing the second half of each year, the sales by the company to hotels grew by 300% in value as room occupancy increased in 2021. Most visitors to Jamaica originate from countries where the vaccine is readily available and whose populations are highly vaccinated. These augured well for continued growth in the hotel industry in 2022.

31. IMPACT OF COVID-19 (CONT’D):

The company’s subsidiary in the Bahamas is less dependent on the hotel industry and recorded steady profits in the seven-month period ended 31 December 2021. This trend is expected to continue throughout 2022.

In 2021 the company continued to add new products to the retail offering. Management also increased the merchandising capability during 2021 to better serve supermarket customers. For 2022, management expects the markets in which the group operates, to begin to return to a new normal in which the population will adapt and coexist with the COVID-19 virus without any significant effect on the economy.
