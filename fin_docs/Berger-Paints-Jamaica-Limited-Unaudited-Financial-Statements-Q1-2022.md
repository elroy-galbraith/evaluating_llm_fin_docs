UNAUDITED Q1 2022 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

Financial Performance

Berger Paints Jamaica Limited (BPJL) began 2022 with a strong performance and recorded revenues of J$719M for the quarter ending March 31, 2022. This represents a 20% increase over the corresponding period in 2021 and continues to build on the momentum gathered over the past year.

BPJL like most manufacturers are being greatly impacted by the ongoing ripple effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and now further compounded by the Ukrainian conflict, particularly with supply chain constraints and rising raw material/consumables cost. Constant and unpredictable price increases, coupled with extended lead times and freight costs continue to pose significant challenges to the daily operations.

Management continues to diligently manage this area of risk, and business continuity plans are constantly being reviewed and updated and we remain committed to the judicious management of risk and costs. This is demonstrated in our prudent control of Manufacturing and Operating expenses for quarter 1, 2022 which totaled $303.6M for Q1 2022, below the $323.8M for Q1 2021, a decrease of $20M or 6.2%. Manufacturing expenses were closely managed and resulted in a 10% or $1.4M reduction over the corresponding quarter in 2021.

Through deeper focus on plant efficiencies, our production output improved and increased by 6% in Q1 2022 over Q1 2021.

As we anticipate challenges with supply chain to continue well into 2022, we remain focused on operational efficiencies and effective utilization of scarce raw material resources. This prudent approach has allowed BPJL to record Profit Before Tax (PBT) of $22.7M for Q1 2022, an increase of $14.3M or 171% over the PBT of $8.4M recorded in Q1 2021.

A strong Statement of Financial Position supports our growth agenda.

Outlook

We are optimistic that economic activity will continue to increase in 2022 as the Government of Jamaica has lifted Covid-19 restrictions, reopened the entertainment industry, and removed Covid-19 test requirements for travel. However, we are cognizant of the ongoing risk to the business due to future outbreaks and internal contagion. We remain committed to delivering on long term strategies and staying focused on serving the needs of all our customers.

We extend our gratitude to you our shareholders for your continued confidence in the Berger brand and on behalf of the Board of Directors and Management of Berger Paints Jamaica Limited, a heartfelt thank you to our team, suppliers, and all stakeholders for your ongoing and continued support.

On behalf of the Board

Adam N. Sabga
Chairman
