REPORT OF DIRECTORS

Jetcon Corporation Limited, Jamaica’s pre-eminent pre-owned car dealers, marked its third year of listing on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange in 2018. We also completed another profitable year of operations, although lower profits were reflected than that of 2017.

ECONOMY
Our performance came against a background of improvement in the local economy. The real economic growth, which approximated 2 percent for the year, resulted in the decline of the official unemployment rate below 9 percent. The economic growth also resulted in the reduction of the overnight bank rate to 1.5 percent by the Central Bank. While loan rates at financial institutions for the purchase of motor vehicles hovered around 7 percent per annum.

Subsequent to the year-end, we also note that the budget for the 2019/20 fiscal year indicates that the government will cut taxes in certain areas. This includes Corporate taxes and an increase in the income tax threshold and wage increase for Public Sector workers. This is expected to improve the buying power and quality of life for Jamaicans and potential car owners. In the short to medium-term, these economic growth initiatives represent positive developments for our industry and are likely to drive demand for our products and services.

Shareholders will be updated on the 2018 financial year developments during our upcoming Annual General Meeting, which will be held at the Knutsford Court Hotel, at 16 Chelsea Avenue, Kingston 5. They will also be provided with insights of the plans and developments that can be expected in 2019.

REVENUES & PROFIT
Our audited Financial Statements show revenues declining modestly from $1.18 billion in 2017 to $1.16 billion in 2018. Operational costs also saw increases in 2018, in our journey towards enhancing the Company’s future growth and development. This resulted in the reduction in profit to $92 million, when compared to $154 million in 2017. This represented the first year of a decline in profit since 2014.

*End of Page 10*

### Page 11

MARKETING
With the realization of profit declines, we swiftly moved to identify other areas of possible income generation and strengthened our servicing department by promoting the servicing of vehicles. This generated a growth in service income by 128 percent for the year 2017.

We also took decisive steps to move to address the declining profits, by investing in new facilities to drive expansion of sales in a sustainable way over the medium-term. This was done by leasing space as a client inside the Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The zone is operated by Kingston Wharves Limited and provides storage space at the port Company’s Tinson Pen location.

Jetcon is one of only two car dealers granted privilege of use and the only pre-owned dealer with access to this facility. The impact of expanding staff and increased spending through the leasing of property at our new location is expected to allow us to expand sales beyond our past capacity.

STOCK PERFORMANCE
The stock which was priced at $2.25 at the time of IPO and adjusted in 2017 for the 3 for 1 stock split to end that year at $5, experienced a slippage in 2018 to close the year at $3.04. However, the number of shareholders in 2018 showed an upward trend of 18 percent increase over 2017, moving from 929 shareholders to end at 1,095 in 2018.

DIVIDEND
The Company paid an interim dividend due within the year of 3.5 cents per share with no further dividend recommended for the year.

DIRECTORS RETIRING
Under the articles of the Company, the following Directors will retire and being eligible, offered themselves for re-election: John Jackson, Christine Clarke-Dougherty and Andrew J. Jackson.

DECLARATION
For the 2019 fiscal year your Directors fully intend to honor their commitment to ensure long term value for stakeholders.

The Directors thank the staff, clients, shareholders and other stakeholders for their efforts that contributed to another successful year for Jetcon Corporation Limited, as we strive to deliver on our commitment.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), of financial status and results of operations, is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the audited Financial Statements and their accompanying notes.

Jetcon Corporation Limited is the leading provider of pre-owned motor vehicles. Our primary business is the sale of cars, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) and small commercial vehicles through imports from Japan, which are supported by licenses granted by the government of Jamaica. Beginning in 2018, these licenses require the procurement of a Pre-Shipment Inspection Certificate, provided by an independent assessor in the vehicles’ country of origin, prior to importation.

The Company also sells parts and offers standalone motor vehicle servicing, scalable to our customers’ needs. Organic growth remains our primary source of funding which may be supplemented by credit funding where necessary.

SALES OPERATION
In many ways, our performance is symbolic of our commitment to the consistent delivery of superior service. This is reflected in the volume of vehicle sales of over 700 units in 2018, with a large percentage of sales repeat purchases from satisfied customers. This we achieved by incorporating valuable feedback into our operations as well as streamlining our internal processes for a more seamless customer experience.

By working in close collaboration with institutions that provide financing to our customers, we have been able to provide a convenient and holistic approach to motor vehicle ownership. This alliance provides timely and reliable solutions for customer requirements as the team remains highly focused on driving operational efficiency and synergies, to create value for our stakeholders.

The acquisition of additional space in 2017 enabled us throughout the year to continue to provide storage capacity for the increased inventory of vehicles to meet growing demands with the January to March quarter of 2018 representing peak quarters in terms of sales volume. In addition, with the acquisition of space in the Special Economic Zone at Tinson Pen Aerodrome, easing the process of importation will enable us to pursue other ventures as well as provide access to a wider variety and volume of vehicles.

The pre-owned car market accounts for about two thirds of all cars imported into the country. This sector provides an important service to the country by delivering affordable and reliable vehicles to a wide cross-section of persons and businesses. The vehicles sold by Jetcon, are by far, more affordable than new ones and can last a considerably long time if properly maintained.

below and as shown in the graph above. Jetcon completed another successful year to December 2018 but with revenues falling by a mere 1.3 percent to $1.16 billion when compared to the previous year, exceeding the billion-dollar mark for the second consecutive year.

In 2017 revenue rose by 37 percent to $1.18 billion and for 2016 revenue amounted to $857 million, a growth of 63 percent over the prior year’s $524 million. The 2015 revenue increased by 50 percent when compared with the $349 million recorded for the 12 months ending December 2014, preceded by moderate declines of 1 percent and 6 percent in 2013 and 2014 respectively.

PROFIT
2018 ended with profits falling by 40 percent to $92 million when compared to 2017, while growths of 55 percent were experienced in 2017, 145 percent in 2016 and 286 percent in 2015.

GROSS PROFIT
Gross Profit for the year fell by 27 percent to $162 million as cost of sales rose 5 percent, partially due to costs related to the leasing of additional space at Tinson pen as well as some discounting to move products. gross profit margin was higher in 2017 when compared to 2018, with records of 19 percent and 14 percent respectively

GROSS PROFIT ANALYSIS
Gross Profits have followed the trend in sales growing by 23 percent in 2011 and 201 percent in 2012. The company experienced two consecutive declines in 2013 and 2014 by 19 percent and 13 percent respectively, while 2015 recorded a 66 percent growth. Gross profit margin, which includes repairs and other costs to ensure vehicles are delivered to customers at the Jetcon brand level of service, has ranged from 14 percent to 19 percent over the 5-year period.

The introduction of customs user fees resulted in a reduction in the gross profit margin in 2013 and 2014, as the company absorbed this cost. Gross profit margin experienced an increase in 2015 due to overall lower acquisition cost of vehicles which allowed the company to increase margins while still maintaining the cost of vehicles at affordable levels. Jetcon also embarked on a new strategy during the latter part of the year that resulted in further lowering of some of our costs. This was changed in 2018 to reduce damage to our vehicles during sea voyage.

Increased sales are also highly beneficial to generating increased profits, as our overhead costs remain relatively stable compared with increased sales activity.

Prior to IPO in 2016 there were marked variations in quarterly sales. Subsequent to the IPO and resulting increase in inventory we are seeing less variations in quarterly sales.

LIQUIDITY
Our primary sources of liquidity in 2018 included funds provided by operations, amounting to $93 million, down from $156 million in 2017 with an additional $41 million injected into the inventory of motor vehicles.

During the year the Company purchased fixed assets amounting to $15.3 million and dividends of $20.4 million.

INCOME TAX
The Company is not subjected to Income Tax rate for 5 years starting from April 2016, due to the listing on the Junior Market which allows for a 5-year tax free status, from April 2016 to March 2021.

BALANCE SHEET
Jetcon’s equity capital grew to $505 million at the end of 2018, from $433 million in 2017 and $294 million, at the end of 2016.

One of the most important items in the Financial Statements is the inventory of motor vehicles. These include landed vehicles and those in transit and not yet in the island. The average inventory turn including goods in transit in 2016, was around 4 months, compared to just 3 months in 2016 and under 2 months in 2015. The increased level of inventories in 2017 onwards facilitates increased sales.

Jetcon has short term credit arrangements with some suppliers and currently, the Company has adequate working capital to fund short term requirements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, including capital expenditures and inventory purchases. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

In addition to the credit facility, the Company also has guarantees provided by financial institutions to the customs department as security relating to customs duty for our in-bonded warehouse.

We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs if required.

CURRENCY MOVEMENTS
Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on our results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit per vehicle, rather than by changes in average retail prices. Large currency movements can materially affect sales with prices being pushed out of the reach of some customers.

There continues to be favorable lending policies by financial institutions for the financing of pre-owned vehicles, including low interest rates for car loans.

RISKS
Interest rates have fallen in Jamaica to the lowest levels ever, but these could rise in 2019 and beyond if demand for loans rise sharply, making borrowing cost greater for the financing of vehicles.

OUTLOOK 2019
As part of the thrust to ensure long term value for our stakeholders, we will be maximizing the use of the additional storage space acquired within the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) at Tinson Pen. The SEZ facility allows us to import and store volumes in excess of 500 motor vehicles, and lays the framework, for the Company to distribute into the local market or engage in re-exportation to the Caribbean region. Jetcon would be the first Jamaican dealership to ever engage in cross-border trade of second-hand vehicles across the region. Early indications for local distribution also show promising results with sales for January 2019 up by 9 percent and 10 percent for February 2019 when compared to the same period for 2018. We will increase resources to serve this purpose, with the intention that success locally will lead to similar ventures in other Caribbean markets.

In the short term, the primary driver for increased earnings will be vehicle unit sales growth and increased revenues from vehicle servicing and sale of parts. We also believe that increased pre-owned vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of parts, ancillary products and vehicle servicing revenues over time.

Continued demand for pre-owned vehicles is expected to continue to be a major part of the motor industry in Jamaica as the vehicles are well received by the motoring public who have been well served by them. This is based on the government’s commitment to implement policies to generate economic growth, increase employment and keep interest rates low, as well as the continuing road infrastructure improvements which, while temporarily a nuisance, will lead to future enjoyment.

In 2018, the government implemented a Pre-Inspection Regime that required all imported cars to be inspected by the relevant authority, in the exporting country. Whilst this Pre-Shipment Inspection Regime had been included in the 2014 Motor Vehicle Policy and had its benefits, the implementation was relatively sudden and led to initial increased costs, which declined as the year went on. We expect costs to further decrease as we make revisions to our pre-delivery preparation strategies.

To expand our vehicle unit sales, we will need to continue our delivery of an unrivalled customer experience. The hiring and development of team members with the necessary drive to fuel our success will be critical. Managing the risks posed by a competitive environment, ensuring a continued flow of vehicles for sale and exploring new sources of revenue are also crucial in our efforts to maximize cash flow and customer satisfaction.

My experience at Jetcon was wonderful. Their customer service is incomparable. Twice I have done business with them and on both occasions the process was seamless. My sales representative gave me the utmost level of comfort while taking me through the process. The smiles, hospitality and efficiency speaks volumes, even the security guard adds to the psychosocial environment. It’s like you’re adopted into a family of love. It took me just days to receive my car and of course, I was very appreciative. I have no regrets doing business with them and would recommend Jetcon to anyone interested in owning a car.

Taking care of our communities also means taking care of our own, and so our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility has led to several philanthropic programs in our effort to restore hope and purpose in society.

We hold ourselves to the highest level of accountability and challenge ourselves to look beyond our own interests. As such one of our major outreach efforts included the donation of a 2013 Nissan AD Wagon to the Nature Preservation Foundation.

Jetcon first embraced the competitive motor sports industry through circuit racing at the Dover Raceway, after which the passion for karting was ignited. Jetcon continues to play a vital role in this field, via its involvement in competitions as well as the sponsorship of several motor sporting events. A continuance of

our admiration for friendly rivalry and competition also led to the sponsorship of the Y-Speedos Swim Club in 2017 and 2018.

With the evolution of vehicle design a reflection of cultural change, the transport industry has also been critical to economic growth. Carts, bicycles, motorcycles and four wheeled motor cars are evidence of the transition Jamaicans have come to know. The progression of motorized transport has changed lifestyles, commute and the face of leisure opportunities. In preservation of our motoring heritage and the memory of the industry which gave us the vehicles we have today, Jetcon now markets ‘classic’ motor cars. This provides opportunities not just for an aesthetically pleasant mobile museum but for further innovation, income, skill training, knowledge and change.

At Jetcon, we recognize that the people who make our brands come to life are our most important asset. Consequently, throughout the year we have offered cash backs and discounts to relieve the financial constraints, customers often experience when owning a vehicle. Over the course of the year contributions were also made to the Jamaica Red Cross, Young Strikers’ Youth Club, Cornwall College and several other charities. 2018 also marked our second-year of participation in the Melbourne Cricket Club’s 5k Walk/Run, which provides support to Special Olympics and the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) - Sickle Cell Unit.

Additionally, we strive to create an environment where employees can grow, thrive and be highly engaged and motivated by their work and in so doing, create an unparalleled experience for our customers here at Jetcon. We are empowered by the simple act of giving and intend to collaborate our efforts and forge relationships for a greater impact in 2019.

Independent auditors’ report

To the Members of
Jetcon Corporation Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Jetcon Corporation Limited (the Company) set out on pages 33 to 52, which comprise statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of company as at December 31, 2018, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis of Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our Audit Approach
Audit Scope
As part of designing our audit, we determined materially and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we consider where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all our audits, we also address the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. Those matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined that there are no key matters to communicate in our report.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises annual Report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and with the requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Independent auditor’s report
Jetcon Corporation Limited

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the company financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the company’s financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the company financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
As required by the Jamaican Companies Act, we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018

1. Identification
The company is incorporated under the Jamaican Companies Act. It’s a 60.31% subsidiary of St. Andrew Investments Limited. Jetcon Corporation Limited and its parent company are domiciled in Jamaica, having their registered offices at 2 Sandringham Avenue, Kingston 10, Jamaica.

The main activities carried out during the year were the importation and sale of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and the servicing of vehicles.

Effective March 24, 2016, the company's shares were listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. Statement of Compliance, Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Statement of Compliance
The financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

(b) Basis of preparation
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company's accounting policies. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and action, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed under their respective headings.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and future years if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Standards, Interpretations and Amendments to published Accounting Standards effective in the current year
During the year, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards became effective. Management has assessed the relevance of all such new standards, interpretations and amendments that became effective January 1, 2018 and have determined that the following will affect the amounts and disclosures in these financial statements:
• IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018
This standard replaces IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and sets out the requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.

Classification and measurement
IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets and reflects the business model in which the asset is managed and the cash flow characteristics of the assets. Accordingly, the basis of measurement for the company's financial assets has been modified. The standard contains three principal classification categories for financial assets:
(a) measured at amortised cost
(b) fair value through other comprehensive income {FVOCI}
(c) fair value through profit or loss [FVTPL]

The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories as held to maturity, loans and receivables available for sale.

*End of Page 37*

---

### Page 38

2. BASIS of PREPARATION and SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(a) Standards, Interpretations and Amendments to published Accounting Standards effective in the current year (continued)
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (continued)
Impairment
IFRS 9 replaces the 'incurred loss' model in IAS 39 with a forward looking 'expected credit loss' [ECL] model. This requires considerable judgement on how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, which is determined on a probability-weighted basis. The probability weighted outcome considers multiple scenarios based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. This new standard is applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI.

Under IFRS 9, loss allowance are measured on either of the following stages, based on the extent of credit deterioration since origination:

i. Stage 1 - 12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date. This stage differs from the current approach which estimates a collective allowance to recognise losses that have been incurred.

ii. Stage 2 - Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. Provisions are higher at this stage because of the increased risk and the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months as in Stage 1

iii. Stage 3 - Financial assets that have an objective evidence of impairment will be included in this stage. Similar to Stage 2, the allowance for credit losses will continue to capture the lifetime expected credit losses.

Lifetime ECL measurement applies if the credit risk of a financial asset at the reporting date has increased significantly since initial recognition and 12-month ECL measurement applies if it has not. An entity may determine that a financial asset's credit risk has not increased significantly if the asset has low credit risk at reporting date. However, lifetime ECL measurement always applies for short-term receivables without a significant financing component.

• IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at the transaction price. Any bundled goods or services that are distinct must be separately recognised, and any discounts or rebates on the contract price must be allocated to the separate elements.

When the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal. Costs incurred to secure contracts with customers have to be capitalised and amortised over the period when the benefits of the contract are consumed. The implementation of this standard does not have a significant effect on how the company's revenue is reported.

*End of Page 38*

---

### Page 39

2. BASIS of PREPARATION and SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
New standards, and interpretations of, and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective:
• IFRS 16, 'Leases' is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The new standard will affect primarily the accounting by leases and will result in the recognition of almost leases on balance sheet. This standard removes the current distinction between operating and financing leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and the financial to pay rentals for virtually all lease contracts. An optional exemption exists for short-term and low-value leases

The new standard will also affect the income statement because the total expense is typically higher in the earlier years of a lease and lower in the later years. Additionally, operating expenses will be replaced with interest and depreciation, so key metrics such as EBITDA will change.

The standard also states that operating cash flow will be higher as cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are classified within financing activities. Only the part of the payments that reflect interest can continue to be presented as operating cash flows.

The accounting by lessors will not significantly change. Some differences may arise as a result of the new guidance on the definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

The company is currently assessing the impact of future adoption of the standard on its financial statements.

Management is evaluating the impact that the foregoing standards and amendments to standard may have on its financial statements when they are adopted.

Significant Accounting Policies
(b) Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the company's activities. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised in the profit or loss when the significant risks and reward of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually when the company has delivered the goods to the customer.

No revenue is recorded if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, the associated costs or possible return of goods.

Revenue is shown net of Consumption Tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, unless collectibility is in doubt.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(c) Foreign Currency Transactions
i. Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ["the functional currency"]. The financial statements are presented in Jamaican dollars, which is also the company's functional currency.

*End of Page 39*

### Page 40

2. BASIS of PREPARATION and SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(c) Foreign Currency Transactions (continued)
ii. Transaction and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Gains or losses arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are recognised in the profit and loss account. Foreign currency balances at the balance sheet date are converted at the rates applicable for that date.

(d) Financial Instruments
Financial Instruments carried on the balance sheet include cash, investments, bank balances, receivables and payables. The particular recognition methods are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each of them.

(e) Plant, Machinery and Equipment
Plant, machinery and equipment and other assets are carried at cost and valuation less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis, (except motor vehicles, which is computed on the reducing balance basis), at rates estimated to write-off the cost of the assets over their expected useful lives. Annual rates used are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Asset</th>
    <th>Depreciation Rate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Freehold buildings</td>
    <td>2 1/2%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment</td>
    <td>10%/20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Computer systems and motor vehicles</td>
    <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Gains and losses on disposal of plant, machinery and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the profit and loss account.

Repairs and maintenance expenditure are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the company.

(f) Impairment of Non-Current Assets
Plant, machinery and equipment and other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the greater of the asset's net selling price and the value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identified cash flows.

(g) Inventories

2. BASIS of PREPARATION and SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

(i) Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoiced amounts less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowable account, and the loss is recognised in the profit or loss. When trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoverables of amount previously written off are credited to the profit or loss.

(j) Accounts payable
Accounts payable is measured at amortised cost. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that affects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(k) Investments
These are classified as available-for-sale investments and are stated at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these securities are recognised in equity revaluation reserve. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the profit or loss account as gains and losses from investment securities. (see note 9)

The fair value of available-for sale investments is based on their quoted market bid price at the balance sheet date. Where the quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques.

(l) Employee Benefits
Annual leave entitlements
Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. At year-end the company had no liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees.

(m) Taxation
(i) Current taxation
Current tax charges are based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from the profit before tax reported because it excludes items that are taxable or deductible in other years, and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated at tax rates that have been enacted at balance sheet date. Current and deferred taxes are recognised as income tax expense or benefit in the profit or loss account except, to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, directly in equity.

(ii) Deferred taxation
A deferred tax charge is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for the financial reporting purposes. The tax rates used in these financial statements are those enacted at balance sheet date.
Deferred tax charges are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts as measured for tax purposes, which will result in taxable amounts in future periods. The carrying amounts of deferred tax is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax to be utilised.

(n) Related party transactions and balances
Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. (referred to in IAS 24 as the "reporting entity"). Related Party transactions and balances are recognised and disclosed for the following:
a. A person or a close member of that person's family is related to a reporting entity if that person:
   i. has control or joint control over the reporting entity;
   ii. has significant influence over the reporting entity; or
   iii. is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or parent of the reporting entity.
b. A reporting entity, if any of the following conditions applies:
   i. the entity and the reporting entity are members of a group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to each other).
   ii. one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
   iii. both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
   iv. the entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.
   v. the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity.
   vi. the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a)(i) above.
   vii. a person identified in (a)(i) above has significant influence over the entity (or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity.

(c). Remission of income tax:
The company's shares were listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica stock Exchange [JSE], effective March 24, 2016. Consequently, the company is entitled to a remission of taxes for ten (10) years in the proportions set out below, provided it complies with the criteria of the Income Tax (Jamaica Stock Exchange Junior Market) regulation and its shares remain listed for at least fifteen (15) years:
To obtain the remission of income taxes, the following conditions should be adhered to over the period:
(i) The company remains listed for at least 15 years and is not suspended from the JSE for any breaches of the rules of the JSE.
(ii) The subscribed participating voting shareholders does not exceed $500 million.
(iii) The company has at least 50 participating voting shareholders.

7. TAXATION (continued)
The financial statement have been prepared on the basis that the company will have the full benefit of the tax remissions. The period is as follows:
Years 1 to 5	100%
Years 6 to 10	50%
As a consequence of the company obtaining a remission of tax status, effective March 24, 2016, the deferred tax asset position at the prior year-end was reversed; therefore reporting a nil deferred tax position at year-end.

8. DIVIDENDS
By resolution dated May 12, 2018 the directors declared the payment of dividend of $.035 per share totalling $20,422,500 to be paid to shareholders on the company's register of members as at June 29, 2018.

The company's freehold land and building were revalued during 2009 by independent valuers, Allison Pitter & Company. The valuation was done on the basis of open market value. The valuation surplus was credited to capital reserves [see note 15(b)]. The directors have assessed the values of land and buildings, based on recent sale of similar properties and have determined that the fair value of freehold properties is $100,625,000.

On June 14, 2017, at the annual general meeting of the company, the shareholders approved the subdivision of each ordinary share into three (3) ordinary shares with effect from June 26, 2017. To facilitate this subdivision of shares, the maximum number of shares that the company is authorised to issue was increased from 194,500,000 to 583,500,000. As a result of the stock split, all prior period stock data presented in the financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the subdivision.

The company repaid its long-term liability during the year.

19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The company had no trading transactions with related parties during the year.

20. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The company's activities exposes it to a variety of financial risk: (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The company seeks to manage these by close monitoring of each class of its financial instruments as follows:

(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The company is exposed to currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than Jamaican Dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions, primarily with respect to purchases, which are denominated in United States dollars. The company does not earn foreign currency to counter the effects of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
The company manages this risk by purchasing foreign currency in advance and maintaining foreign currency accounts to satisfy its foreign creditors.

20. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
(a) Market risk (continued)
Foreign currency sensitivity
Due to the nature of the company's operations and the very short term nature of balances denominated in currencies other than the Jamaican dollar, there is no material impact on its operations as a result of changes in foreign currency rates. The company makes advance payments on foreign purchases, this serves to counter the long-term effect of changes in the exchange rates.

The exchange rates applicable at balance sheet date are US$ 1 = J$126.8307 (2017= J$124.0571) in respect of foreign currency assets and US$ 1 = J$127.9683 (2017 = J$125.0936) in respect of foreign currency liabilities.

(ii) Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded on the market. The company's exposure in relation to financial instrument is minimal as these are recorded at face value and no diminution in value is expected.

(iii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The company's cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk. The level of interest bearing deposits is low and the company has not been able to negotiate the most advantageous interest rates in relation to its overdraft; however, the terms of its long-term borrowings are considered comparable to market, based on current trends.

Interest rate sensitivity
The company has interest-bearing liabilities in the form of overdraft and is exposed to interest rate risk and this is affected by movements in market interest rates.

Significant movements in interest rates could affect the company's operations: however, at balance sheet date its level of borrowings was minimal; therefore, the associated risk level is considered low.

(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk arising from a counterparty to a financial contract failing to discharge its obligations, and arises principally from the company's receivables from customers, cash and investment securities.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. The company's exposure to this risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer.

Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the company and a failure to make contractual payments for a period greater than 120 days past due.

Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are presented as net impairment losses within based operating profit. Sebsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

(b) Credit risk (continued)
