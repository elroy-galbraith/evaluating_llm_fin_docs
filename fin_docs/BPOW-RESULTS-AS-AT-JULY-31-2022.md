Chairman’s Report for the First Quarter Ended July 31, 2022

Blue Power Group generated revenues of $214 million and earned net profit of $7 million for the first quarter ended July 31, 2022 (the “First Quarter”). Blue Power delivered outstanding growth in sales volumes and revenues, in line with its plan to develop and diversify the customer base. Earnings in the First Quarter were affected by disruptions to the supply chain and unprecedented increases in raw material prices, that we expect to normalize during the year.

Revenue Growth

Revenues for Blue Power grew 85% during the First Quarter, relative to the same period in the prior year. We experienced revenue growth in all of our main product categories including our bath soap lines, specialty soaps and our laundry soap business. Revenue growth came from existing and new customers and saw the group gaining market share locally and re-enforcing its reputation as a leading private label manufacturer.

Earnings Performance

Despite the strong overall revenue performance, the Group faced challenges in the First Quarter. Importantly, one-off gains on the sale of investments and foreign exchange gains that formed part of our finance income last year were not repeated in the First Quarter of this year. In addition, our gross margins suffered as a result of dramatic increases in raw materials prices, challenges to the actual availability of products from some of our sources, and a spike in logistics costs (particularly for products originating in Asia). The market for vegetable oils – a basic input in soap production – was disrupted in the early part of the calendar year due to the war in the Ukraine. Logistics costs were affected by the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Our key inputs have long lead times for procurement and shipping and although the market has now clearly showed signs of normalizing, our First Quarter margins were adversely affected. The combined effect of these challenges was a reduction in net profits from $46 million in the prior year first quarter to $7 million this year. Note should be made that in November 2021, in accordance with accounting standards the accounting for Blue Power Groups investment in Lumber Depot changed from equity accounting to share of associate company. With this change, total comprehensive income stood at $7 million when compared to $69 million in prior year.

Outlook

An important part of our plan for profitable business growth, is our commitment to efficiency and innovation. During the quarter we continued our capital projects to expand our capacity and productivity and to give our manufacturing plant more flexibility in the sources of raw material. We expect to see the results of this investment in the second half of 2023. We also secured the long-term expansion prospects for the business with the acquisition of a two-acre plot of land that is adjacent to our existing facility. The site includes a building that is suitable for renovation as well as land space with excellent development potential for a purpose-built industrial facility. We expect to complete our development plan for the property during the course of the year.

The Blue Power Group’s balance sheet, investment portfolio and liquidity remain strong. This has allowed us to increase our inventory levels to manage some of the supply chain disruptions. Our investment in Lumber Depot Limited, which is a significant part of our holdings, performed satisfactorily in the First Quarter.

We continue to be optimistic about the competitive position and growth prospects for our business in Jamaica, as well as the opportunity to develop new export markets. We are also well prepared to diversify the business through opportunistic investments in related businesses and in our real estate.

I thank our customers, staff, management team and board for their commitment to the business.

Blue Power Group Limited
Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements
July 31, 2022

1 Identification and principal activities
Blue Power Group Limited (the company) is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica. The registered office of the company is located at 4 Victoria Avenue, Kingston CSO. The company is listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.
The company and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries are referred to as the "group"

The main activities of the company and the group comprise the manufacture and sale of soaps and the sale of lumber, hardware supplies and other related products.

2 Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance:
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and comply with the provisions of the Jamaican Companies Act.

(b) Basis of consolidation:

(i) Subsidiaries:
A “subsidiary” is an enterprise controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Papine Properties Limited and Cotrade Limited made up to April 30, 2022. Cotrade Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Papine Properties Limited, which is owned by Blue Power Group Limited. The company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “the group”. These subsidiaries are currently dormant, and the shareholdings are the same for 2022 and 2021. Cotrade Limited is the group’s nominee for holding properties from which the group manages its operations. The parent company administers the affairs of the subsidiaries and bears the related expenses. Papine Properties Limited is registered in the British Virgin Islands and Cotrade Limited is registered in Jamaica.

(ii) Associates:

Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence, but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs.

The group’s investment is carried at the group’s share of the fair value of net identifiable assets of the associate net of any impairment loss identified on acquisition.

The group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or

*End of Page 7*

### Page 8

loss and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the profits, losses or movements are consistent with the group’s significant accounting policies. Should the group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group will not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Balances and transactions between companies within the group, and any unrealised gains arising from those transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated to the extent of the company’s interest in the subsidiary. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

(c ) New and amended standards that became effective during the period
Certain new and amended standards which were in issue, came into effect during the current financial period. The adoption of these standards did not have any impact on the amounts recognized or disclosures in the financial statements.

3 Use of estimates and judgements:
The preparation of the financial statements to conform to IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the reporting date and the income and expense for the year then ended. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

4 Financial instruments:
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In these financial statements, financial assets comprise investments, cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Financial liabilities comprise accounts payable and due to related party.

5 Revenue:
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The company recognises revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer.

6 Foreign currencies:
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are measured at historical cost, are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. Foreign exchange differences arising from fluctuations in exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.
