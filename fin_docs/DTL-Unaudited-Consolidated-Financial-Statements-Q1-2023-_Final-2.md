The three (3) months consolidated results of the Group reflect revenue of $4.92 billion which is $682.03 million (16.09%) over the $4.23 billion reported for the comparative period last year. The results include all subsidiaries of Derrimon Trading Company Limited. The growth in revenue is driven by improved performances from many of our subsidiaries notwithstanding the current worldwide economic climate. The Group continues to provide innovative products which add value to our customers and this has aided to navigate exogenous shocks to our business.

The Group reported gross profit of $1.02 billion which represents an increase of $218.41 million (27.19%) above the $803.21 million reported for the comparative period last year. Central to this improvement was our adherence for sourcing products at the best possible cost to ensure our competitiveness within the market. Additionally, the focus on new products that appealed to our relevant business segments was instrumental in this improvement.

Consolidated operating expenses for the three (3) months was $898.10 million representing an increase of $241.10 million (36.70%) over the $657.00 million reported for the comparative period last year. The increase was mainly due to the impact arising from the consolidation of the cost of our new subsidiary, Arosa Limited, and our new Select Grocers store in Clarendon this quarter (these were not applicable in 2022). Other notable increases were seen in utilities, salaries, distribution costs, and new operating cost from some of our other subsidiaries.

The Group profit before tax for this period was $70.01 million, a decrease of $127.69 million (64.59%) over the $197.70 million reported for the comparative period and net profit of $52.51 million representing a decrease of $120.48 million (69.65%) below the $172.99 million reported for the comparative period. These results were impacted by higher administrative and finance cost during the period. We anticipate that these costs will reduce in the upcoming quarters based on the strategic initiatives that are upcoming.

The Group total assets less current liabilities was $11.47 billion compared to the $9.52 billion reported for similar period in 2023. This position was influenced by the consolidation of the assets of all the Companies including the new subsidiary Arosa Limited, the new Select Grocers, improvements in all subsidiaries as well the continued adoption of IFRS 16 which requires specific treatment of the accounting for leases. This is reflected in the captioned “Rights of Use of Assets” on the face of the Balance Sheet.

Core Activity

The Distribution and local Retail arm of the business recorded revenue of $3.29 billion for the first quarter which represents growth of $467.84 million or 16.57% over the comparative March 31, 2022 ending quarter. The major contributor to this growth was recorded within the retail segment of the business given the addition of the new retail store as well as sterling performances from some of our other stores. We continue to implement strategies to improve and expand our offering within our channels whilst ensuring that we remain available, presentable and our offerings are reflective of our customers’ expectations. Our mantra of “available and fresh” will ensure that our customers are always satisfied.

The full reposition of our distribution business was accelerated at the beginning of 2023 though the introduction of many products under the ‘Delect’ brand. We are very encouraged based on the market acceptance thus far, that the decision and timing was correct. The continued redefining of this business unit and ensuring that our proprietary brands attract additional world class principals will ensure the long-term sustainability and growth in profitability.

We continue to navigate the various challenges within the company as the impact from adversities with logistics and supply chain negatively affected the business in the first quarter. The delays experienced with supplies and the influx of orders from many of our suppliers at once impacted our bottom line due to excess demurrages along with the cost for extra off-site storage. Our resilience and strength as a company allowed us to navigate that storm despite the operational and financial challenges.

The general price increases of food, overall inflation and reduction in disposable income of consumers continue to be reflected in our consumers’ spending patterns and is reflected in the data gleaned from the average basket size within our retail business. The business however, was positively boosted by the re-opening of many schools, the tourism sectors, the increase in purchases of care packages from charitable organisations and other social groups along with online shopping.

Gross profit from these Divisions for the three (3) months period was $557.30 million which represents a $96.88 million (21.04%) increase above the $460.42 million reported for the corresponding period last year. The restructuring of the retail group, introduction of our ‘Delect’ brand of products, increase focus on inventory losses, category management that attracts categories of products that generate specific

hurdle returns and improving of our distribution effectiveness within the wholesale and modern trade are our pillars for success in 2023. We continue to implement many initiatives and strategies to ensure that there will be improvements in margins in both Divisions of the business. This process will yield the desired outcome as the strategies are fully implemented in 2023.

Operating Expenses for the three (3) months period was $635.36 million which is $220.09 million (53%) above the $415.27 million reported for the comparative period last year. The major factors for this increase were salaries, utilities, and distribution costs inclusive of trucking costs. We continue to examine some of these costs and will implement specific strategies in order to reduce the impact of them on the core business.

Finance charges for the core activities for the three (3) months period was $115.55 million compared to $82.60 million. The full adoption of IFRS 16 reflects the accounting for leases and the desired treatment for foreign exchange movement in these leases, hence now being reported in finance charges. During the quarter we had to recalculate the USD leases to capture the movement in the exchange rate as a result of the depreciation of the Jamaican dollar and introduction of the new Select Grocers which negatively impacted our finance cost for the quarter.

A pre-tax loss was recorded for the three (3) months period at $143.96 million compared to a pre-tax profit of $93.95 million for the comparative period last year. The pre-tax loss for this year was triggered by the increase finance cost along with higher administrative cost.

Total Assets less Current Liabilities from core activities was at $9.34 billion, this represents an increase of $1.44 billion above the $7.89 billion reported for the similar period last year.

We thank our employees for their commitment and dedication and we are encouraged by the support given by all our stakeholders.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied for all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost conventions. The accounting policies used in the preparations of these interim financial statements are consistent with those used in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

Basis of preparation

Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) using the accounting policies described herein.

*End of Page 11*

### Page 12

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Going concern
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS assumes that the Company and Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. This means, in part, that the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position assume no intention or necessity to liquidate or curtail operations. This is commonly referred to as the going concern basis. Management has assessed that the Company and Group have the ability to continue as a going concern and has prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis.

Basis of presentation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following, which are measured at fair value:

    • Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income; and
    • Revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment

Revenues and expenses
Revenues and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis, whereby transactions and events are recognized in the period in which the transactions and events occur, regardless of whether there has been a receipt or payment of cash or its equivalent.

Judgments and Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect:

    • The application of accounting policies;
    • The reported amounts of assets and liabilities;
    • Disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities; and
    • The reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.

Actual results may differ from estimates made in these consolidated and separate financial statements. The use of estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial statements and does not undermine their reliability.

Judgments are made in the selection and assessment of the Company’s accounting policies. Estimates are used mainly in determining the measurement of recognized transactions and balances. Estimates are based on historical experience, and other factors, including expectations of future events, believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Judgments and estimates are interrelated. Management’s judgments and estimates are continually re-evaluated to ensure they remain appropriate. Revision to accounting estimates is recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in the future periods affected.

The following are the accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates that the Management believes could have the most significant impact on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Operating segments information

Judgment – Management uses judgment in determining the similarity of the economic characteristic of the segments for aggregation.

Financial assets

Judgment – Financial assets are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss based on a) the company’s business model for managing the financial assets and b) the contractual cash flow characteristic of the financial assets. Judgment is required in determining the business model and its objective.

Revenue from contract with customers

Judgment – is required in a) identifying performance obligations and determining the timing of the satisfaction of the performance obligations and b) the transaction price and the amount allocated to the performance obligations.

Estimation – if the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the company is required to estimate the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer.

Leases

Estimation – The initial measurement of the Lease Liability is based on an estimate of the present value of the lease payments outstanding, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Also, the cost of the right-of-use asset comprises an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

Consolidation

Judgment – The Company uses judgment in determining the entities that it controls and accordingly consolidates. An entity is controlled when the Company has power over the entity, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the number of returns it receives from the entity. If facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the control elements, the Company reassess whether it still has control.

Joint arrangement

Judgment – Management applies judgment in determining the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved. The classification of the joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement, its structure and legal form, the terms agreed by the parties in the contractual arrangement, and when relevant, other facts and circumstances.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Investment property

Judgment – Management applies judgment in determining whether a property qualifies as an investment property. Criteria are developed to allow management to exercise that judgment consistently.

Related parties and related party transactions

Judgment – Management uses judgment in determining the level of details to be disclosed. Consideration is given to the closeness of the related party relationship and other factors relevant in establishing the level of significance of the transaction(s).

Receivables

Estimation – Management’s estimate of allowance on accounts receivable is based on an analysis of the Aged Receivables and measurement of the Expected Credit Losses. The Company measure expected credit losses by applying an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

Income and other taxes

Judgment – Income and other taxes are subject to Government policies. In calculating current and recoverable income and other taxes, Management uses judgment when interpreting the tax rules and in determining the tax position. There are some transactions and events for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.

Estimation – Income and other taxes are subject to Government policies, and estimates are required in determining the provision. Management recognizes liabilities for possible tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes may be due.

Contingencies

In determining the existence of a contingent liability, management assesses the existence of:

• A possible obligation that arises from a past event and which existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company, or;

• A present obligation that arises from a past event but is not recognized because it is not possible that an outflow of economic benefit is required to settle or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. In estimating possible outflow of economic benefits In relation to a contingent liability, management, sometimes in consultation with experts such as legal counsel may or may not make provision in the financial statements based on judgments regarding possible outcomes according to specific but uncertain circumstances. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the financial statements unless immaterial or the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.

*End of Page 14*

### Page 15

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Inventories

Estimation – Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realized value. Cost is measured at the weighted average basis, the estimation of net realized value is based on the most reliable evidence available, at the time the estimates are made, of the amount the inventories are expected to realize. Additionally, estimation is required for inventory provision due to shrinkage, slow-moving and expiration.

Impairment of assets

Judgment – Management uses judgment in determining the grouping of assets to identify the Cash-Generating Units (“CGUs”) for testing for impairment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”), Intangibles and Goodwill. Management has determined that its three (3) strategic business units are its CGUs which comprise Distribution (Household products, detergents and bulk foods), Wholesale (Trading outlets and supermarkets) and Other Operations (Manufacturer of flavours and fragrances; and wood products). In testing for impairment of PPE, these assets are allocated to the CGUs to which they relate.

Judgment has been used, at each reporting date, in determining whether there has been an indication of impairment which would require the completion of impairment testing.

Estimation – Management’s estimates of a CGUs’ recoverable based on value-in-use involves estimating future cash flows before taxes. Future cash flows are estimated based on a multi-year extrapolation of the last five years historical actual results and a terminal value by discounting the final year in perpetuity. The growth rate applied to the terminal value is based on the Bank of Jamaica’s target inflation rate or Management’s estimate of the growth rate specific to the individual item being tested. The future cash flow estimates are then discounted to their present value using the appropriate pre-tax discount rate, which includes a risk premium specific to the business. The final determination of a CGUs’ recoverable amount is based on fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use.

Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. This is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and not to exceed the original carrying amount before its impairment. The reversal is also recognized in other comprehensive income.

Others

Estimation – Other estimates include determining the useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment for depreciation; in accounting for and measuring payables and accruals and in measuring fair values of financial instruments.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards effective in the current year.

The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and adopted, and, accordingly, have been applied in preparing the financial statements.

Leases (IFRS 16)
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases, which replace IAS 17– Leases and related interpretations. IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12-months or less or the underlying assets has a low value. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting in IAS 17 with the distinction between operating and finance leases being retained.

Annual Improvements 2015-2017

In December 2017, the IASB issued amendments to four standards, including IFRS 3 – Business Combinations, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12 – Income Taxes and IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs.

The amendment to IFRS 3 clarifies how a company re-measures its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains control of a business. The amendments to IAS 12 clarify that all income tax consequences of dividends should be recognized in profit or loss, regardless of how the tax arises. The amendment to IAS 23 clarifies that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity generally borrows when calculating the capitalization rate on general borrowings.

Effects of Changes in Accounting Policies

The Company and Group adopted IFRS 16: Leases, effective January 1, 2019. This resulted in material changes to the financial statements as at March 31, 2020.

The change in accounting policy was made in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 16. These provisions required the Company and Group to recognize right-of-use assets and Lease Liability in the statement of financial position. And, depreciation expense on right-of-use in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

In addition, the Company and Group applied the practical expedient of continuing with contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease and not to apply leases to contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

IFRS 16: Leases, will be applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings, comparative information will not be restated.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

On January 10, 2022, DTCL acquired 100% of the shares of Spicy Hill Farms Limited, a manufacturer of spices making it a wholly-owned subsidiary.

On April 1, 2022, DTCL acquired 100% of the shares of Arosa Limited, a meat processor, purveyor and wine distributor making it a wholly-owned subsidiary.

(b) Joint operation

A joint operation is an arrangement in which two or more parties contractually agree to the sharing of control and decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a joint operation, the parties that have joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.
The Company records its interest in the joint operation’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the Group accounts.

(c) Business combination

The company applies the acquisition method in accounting for a business combination.
The consideration transferred by the company to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by the company.
The company recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognized in the company’s financial statements prior to the acquisition. Assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisition-date fair value.

Any Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable net assets. If the fair values of the identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount, i.e., gain on bargain purchase, is recognized in profit or loss immediately.

Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed immediately.

Non-controlling interests
Equity in the Company not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company, is considered non-controlling interest. When the proportion of the equity held by non-controlling interest’s changes, the Company adjusts the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect the changes in their relative interest in the Company. The Company recognizes directly in equity any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted, and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, and attribute it to the shareholders of the Company.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(d) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses. The operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.

The Company has identified the following segments:

1. Distribution (Household products, chilled and ambient beverages, detergents and bulk foods);
2. Retail (Trading outlets and supermarkets); and
3. Other Operations (Manufacturer of flavours and fragrances, pallets and by products of wood)

In 2018, the ambient beverages division was added to the distribution segment as the Company entered into an agreement with SM Jahleel and Company Limited to distribute its beverage products. The pallets and by-products of wood were added to the other operations segment as a result of the 100% acquisition of Woodcats International Limited in 2018 and the purchase of Marnock LLC trading as FoodSavers New York and Good Foods For Less in January 2021 resulting in these companies becoming a part of the Group.

(e) Impairment of assets
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, investment property, and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Indicators of impairment may include a significant decline in asset market value, material adverse changes in the external operating environment which affect how the asset is used or is expected to be used, obsolescence, or physical damage of the asset.

If any such indicators exist, then the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired.

(f) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized when the company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods.

The promised goods are transferred when or as the customer obtain control.

Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods as described below:

i. Sales

The performance obligation, satisfied at a point-in-time, to transfer products to customers. Revenue is recognized when the products are delivered to the customers, and the customers take control of the products, and the company has a present right to payment as evidence by an invoice or the right to invoiced

ii. Interest income
The performance obligation, satisfied over time, the company simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs. Revenue is recognized when earned.

iii. Dividend income
The performance obligation, satisfied at a point-in-time, the company simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs. Revenue is recognized when declared, and the right to receive payment is established.

iv. Other operating income
Includes gains and losses on disposal of assets, rental income received from investment properties and miscellaneous inflows. The performance obligation, satisfied at a point-in-time, the company simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs. Revenue is recognized when received from customers.

(g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of items. The land is carried at cost and is not depreciated.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liability.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis at such rates that will write off the carrying value of the assets over the period of their expected useful lives or lease term.

Current annual rates of depreciation are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Buildings</th>
    <td>2.5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Leasehold improvement</th>
    <td>2.5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Machinery and equipment</th>
    <td>10.0%</td>

    <td>33.33%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Right-of-use</th>
    <td>Straight-line over the period of the lease term</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed periodically for impairment. Where the assets’ carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized in other income in the statement of other comprehensive income. Repairs and maintenance expenditure are included in the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that the future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Company.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related cost to put the asset into service. Borrowing costs, including but not limited to, interest on borrowings and exchange differences arising on such borrowings, that are directly attributable to the acquisition and/or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Capitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its use are complete. Thereafter, borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss when they are incurred.

Right-of-use assets are initial measurement at the present value of the lease payments outstanding, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate and include an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.

(h) Leases (right-of-use assets)
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This is reassessed if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.

Lessee
At January 1, 2019, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
Initial measurement of the right-of-use asset is at cost, cost being the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate; plus an estimate of costs to be incurred on retiring the asset, i.e., asset retirement obligations required by the terms and conditions of the lease. The cost is remeasured if the terms of the lease changes.

The Company has elected to not to apply the right-of-use asset and lease liability to:

(a) short-term leases, less than 12-months; and
(b) leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, i.e., printers, laptop computers, small furniture and selected properties.

These will be charged as lease expense in the statement of profit or loss.

(I) Intangible assets

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is impaired, when the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill is allocated, carrying value is higher than the recoverable value of the unit. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed.

Other intangibles – brand name, formula, customer and supplier relationships and technological expertise.

Other intangible represents the identified asset embedded in excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

*End of Page 21*

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Other intangible is tested annually for impairment. Other intangible is impaired when the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the other intangible applies, carrying value is higher than the recoverable value of the unit. Impairment of other intangible is reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized, and only to the extent of the original impairment loss

Research and development expenditure

Expenditures in relation to research activities are expensed as incurred.

Expenditure in relation to development activities is recognized as an asset if, and only if, the Company can demonstrate all of the following; otherwise, it is expensed as incurred:

(a) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.

(b) its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

(c) its ability to use or sell the intangible asset.

(d) how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset.

(e) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.

(f) its ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

(j) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a receipt or payment in cash or its equivalents, and a financial asset of one party and a financial liability or equity instrument of another party. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument. All financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Subsequent measurement of these assets and liabilities is based on fair value or amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than financial assets and financial liabilities classified as Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are recognized immediately in net income.

Classification and Subsequent Measurement

Financial assets
The Company classifies financial assets according to its business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. All the financial assets are classified in the measurement category amortized cost because the financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.

Credit risk and expected credit loss

The Company is only expose to credit risk on its trade receivables, and as such does not provide for any lifetime expected credit loss (LECL). It applies the practical experience of not adjusting the promised consideration receivable because the period is less than 12-months.

The Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are classified and measured as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Asset/Liability</th>
    <th>Classification</th>
    <th>Measurement</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Receivables</td>
    <td>Amortized cost</td>

(k) Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined based on the weighted average cost and includes costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Inventories comprised finished goods, work-in-progress, and raw and packaging materials.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventory during the normal course of business less estimated selling expenses.

(l) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are carried at anticipated realizable value. An allowance for expected credit loss (ECL) of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of this ECL allowance, and the amount of the loss is recognized in Bad Debt expense in the statement of profit or loss. When trade receivable is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognized as recovery and credited to bad debt expense in the statement of profit or loss.

(m) Income tax
The income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current taxation
Current tax charge is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in effect at the reporting date plus any over or under provision of tax in respect of previous years.

Deferred taxation
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their amounts as measured for tax purposes, which will result in taxable amounts in future periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences which will result in deductible amounts in future periods, but only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these differences can be utilized.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the asset will be realized or the liability will be settled based on enacted rates.

At December 31, 2018, deferred tax was accounted for because DTCL 100% tax free remission status expired December 16, 2018. DTCL will be subject to 50% income tax on its taxable profits from December 17, 2018 to December 16, 2023. The recent Additional Public Offering which increased the Company’s capital beyond the allowable $500 million threshold means that the taxation payable is now 100%. The company is awaiting a response from Tax Administration Department to our request to continue with the 50% for the last three (3) years.

(i) CFFL, is also listed on the Junior Market of the JSE and effective October 3,2018, its 100% tax free status expired, and it is now subject to income tax at 50% on its taxable profits for the next five (5) years to October 2, 2023; and

(ii) The other subsidiaries, Woodcats International, Arosa Limited and Marnock LLC are not listed on the Junior Market of the JSE and are subject to payment of full income tax.

(n) Borrowing; borrowing cost and interest

Borrowing (loans) is classified as current when the Company expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle, it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading, the liability is due to be settled within 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position, or it does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position. Otherwise, it is classified as long-term. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment, with gains and losses recognized in net income in the period that the liability is derecognized.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of these assets. Capitalization of such borrowing costs ceases when the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

(o) Share capital, dividends and distributions

Shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are deducted, net of tax from proceeds.

Dividends
Dividends declared, and payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognized as a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Distributions
Distributions to non-controlling interest are recognized as a liability in the consolidated statement of financial position in the period in which the distributions are declared.

(p) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on the Group and Company net profit attributable to shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 4,533,360,670 (2021 – 2,853,360,670). New shares were issued and listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange on February 23, 2021 given the successful Additional Public Offer.

6. INCOME TAX

Derrimon Trading Company Limited (DTCL) is listed on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange, effective December 17, 2013, and under the Income Tax Act (Jamaica Stock Exchange Junior Market) (Remission) Notice 2010, 100% of income taxes will be remitted by the Minister of Finance during the first five (5) years of listing, which expired December 17, 2018. DTCL is now required to account for income tax at 50% during the second five (5) years, from December 17, 2018, to December 16, 2023.

To obtain the remission of income taxes, the following conditions should be adhered to over the period:
(a) DTCL remains listed for at least 15 years and is not suspended from the JSE for any breaches of the rules of the JSE;
(b) The Subscribed Participating Voting Share Capital of DTCL does not exceed $500 million; and
(c) DTCL has at least 50 Participating Voting Shareholders.

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that DTCL will have the full benefit of the tax remissions. The period is as follows:

Years 1 to 5 (December 17, 2013- December 16, 2018) – 100%
Years 6 to 10 (December 17, 2018- December 16, 2023) - 50%

DTCL’s subsidiary, CFFL also benefits from tax remission effective October 2, 2013, the Company’s shares were listed on the Junior Market of the JSE. Effective October 3, 2018, the 100% remission status expired and CFFL is now subject to Income Tax at 50% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company is entitled to a remission of income taxes for (10) ten years in the following proportion:

Period October 3, 2013 – October 2, 2018 - 100% of standard rate.
Period October 3, 2018 – October 2, 2023 – 50% of standard rate.

The recent Additional Public Offering which increased the Company’s capital beyond the allowable $500 million threshold. As a result, the company does not qualify to claim the 50% remission of Income Tax which means that the taxation payable is at the normal 25% rate.
