CHAIRMAN’S REPORT

Dear Shareholder,

The Group recorded profit after taxation for the financial year 2022 in excess of a billion dollars. Despite continued volatility in the investment markets brought about by geopolitical events and economic challenges, the Group remained resilient and continues to focus on optimising performance, capitalising on emerging opportunities, while at the same time managing and mitigating known and emerging risks. Profit attributable to equity holders amounted to $1,100 million, a 41% increase over the $782 million recorded in 2021. Earnings per share increased to $4.74 compared to $3.37 in prior year.

The Group’s net result from insurance activities increased by 45% to $1,537 million, up from $1,061 million reported in 2021. Gross Written Premiums also increased to $7,297 million, 4% more than the $7,030 million reported for financial year 2021. The excellent performance was driven by our Life, Health and Pension (LHP) segment, which contributed an after tax profit of $1,158 million, up 40% over the prior year. As communicated previously, this year the operations achieved returns from our transformation programme as well as synergies from the alignment of our LHP operations in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. During the year, these activities resulted in long-term cost savings that had the effect of creating favourable reserve movements.

The Property and Casualty including Brokerage (P&C) segment also reported increases in after tax profit of $49 million or 30% over 2021, principally from organic growth in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.

After tax profits from our investing and non-insurance related activities, including asset management, declined year over year by $63 million or 31%. Additionally, net income from investing activities also experienced declines of $276 million or 17% from $1,611 million for the corresponding period in 2021 to $1,335 million in 2022. This was due to volatile market conditions which adversely impacted our investment portfolios.

Operating expenses increased by 3% year over year and are mainly related to our growth strategies across the Group’s business segments coupled with our IFRS 17 implementation activities in preparation for compliance with the impending standard.

With the dawn of 2023, IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2023. The Group has embraced the change and is well poised to report in 2023 in accordance with the requirements of the new accounting standard.

As we continue to navigate changes, both planned and unforeseen, the Group remains steadfast, resolute and prepared to successfully face the road ahead. Based upon this performance, our Directors have proposed a final dividend of 52 cents per share, which will bring the total dividend to 72 cents per share. This dividend will be paid to Shareholders on record on 14th March, 2023, when the register of members will be closed for this purpose. The Directors have fixed a date for the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of 4th May, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. at the Guardian Corporate Centre, 1 Guardian Drive, Westmoorings. The AGM will be held in person with the option of virtual attendance via a live online webcast. The formal Notice of Annual Meeting with the Directors’ Report and audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31st December, 2022 will be communicated to Shareholders in due course.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF GUARDIAN HOLDINGS LIMITED

Our opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying summary consolidated financial statements of Guardian Holdings Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, the Group), are consistent, in all material respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements, on the basis described in note 1.

The summary consolidated financial statements
The Group’s summary consolidated financial statements derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 comprise:

• the summary consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the summary consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
• the summary consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
• the related notes to the summary consolidated financial statements.

The summary consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards. Reading the summary consolidated financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon, therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited consolidated financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon.

We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on the audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated 27 February 2023. That report also includes the communication of key audit matters. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the audited consolidated financial statements of the current period.

Management’s responsibility for the summary consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of the summary consolidated financial statements on the basis described in note 1.

Auditor’s responsibility

Note 1: Basis of Preparation
The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with criteria developed by management. Under management’s established criteria, management discloses the summary consolidated statement of financial position, summary consolidated statement of comprehensive income, summary statement of changes in equity and summary consolidated statement of cash flows. These summary financial statements are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Guardian Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2022.

The summary consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in “Note 2” of the 31 December 2022 audited consolidated financial statements consistently applied from period to period. Any new accounting standards or interpretations which became effective in this financial year have had no material impact on the Group. The areas of critical accounting estimate and judgment as disclosed in “Note 3” of the 31 December 2022 audited consolidated financial statements, have also remained unchanged.

Note 2: IFRS 17 Update
Effective 1 January 2023, the Group will implement IFRS 17, ‘Insurance Contracts’. The 2022 financial statements are therefore the last to be reported under the existing IFRS 4 regime. The new standard materially changes the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts and the corresponding presentation and disclosure in the Group’s financial statements. Further information will be provided in the Group’s publication of its financial results for the first quarter of 2023.
