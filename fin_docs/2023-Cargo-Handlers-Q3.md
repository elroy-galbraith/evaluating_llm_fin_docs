Management Discussions and Analysis

We are pleased to share the results of our performance for the quarter ending June 30, 2023 where we achieved revenues totalling $106.66M, which was 15.7% or $19.93M below the results of the corresponding period in 2022. This result is attributable in part to a 21% reduction in containerized cargo throughput, consequent to the suspension LNG deliveries via ISO containers as well as the absence of cruise homeporting activities this period, relative to the prior year.

Operating expenses for the quarter amounted to $56.94M, which represented an increase of 12% over the corresponding three months. This result was due to improvements to staff wages and benefits taking effect during this period. Income derived from Cargo Handlers’ share of associate’s profit for the quarter was $25.15M and contributed to net profit of $74.27M before tax; this result being $21.9M below the $96.16M realized for the corresponding quarter. Earnings per share decreased to $0.17 for the 3-month period, from $0.21 in the corresponding quarter in 2022.

Local economic activities are positively influencing Cargo Handlers’ revenue streams. Our equipment rental and associated fuel logistics management segments, reflected significant improvement relative to the corresponding period last year as operational activities return to pre-pandemic levels. Over the near-term, our renewal of key pieces of petroleum tankers and haulage units, will further improve income derived from our lease arrangement with affiliate Bulk Liquid Carriers through increased efficiencies and extended fleet serviceability.

We continue to monitor those threats that present hazards to the shipping industry and could still further challenge the supply chain. Inflation remains a concern coupled with geopolitical instabilities among some of the world’s major economies, which continues to weigh heavily on global commodity prices and trade. Notwithstanding, there are encouraging indicators coming out of the industry we operate in, with increased cruise vessel calls being forecasted for Montego Bay. We anticipate that the various infrastructure projects and commercial developments underway inside western Jamaica will also continue to buoy activities across the port and positively influence cargo flows.

Cargo Handlers is committed to the partnerships we have forged within our local community over the years and will continue to support the causes that affect people’s lives in a positive way.

1. Identification and Principal Activity

The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Jamaica and has its registered office at Montego Freeport Shopping Centre, Montego Bay. The Company's principal activity is the provision of stevedoring services, equipment leasing and the provision of management services

The Company is listed company on the Junior Market of the Jamaica Stock Exchange.

2. Basis of preparation

The interim financial statements for the period 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with and in compliance with financial reporting standards. These interim financial statements were presented in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reports”, and follows the same accounting policies and method of computation that were used in the annual audit financial statements September 30, 2022

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statement are disclosed in Note 4.

3. Critical Accounting Judgments and key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Estimates and judgments used in preparing the financial statements of the Company are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has arrived at no judgments which it believes would have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in these financial statements. Also, management has derived no estimates for inclusion in these financial statements which it believes have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
