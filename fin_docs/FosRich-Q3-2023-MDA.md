Business Overview
FosRich is primarily a distributor of lighting, electrical and solar energy products. FosRich aims to differentiate itself from its competitors in the Jamaican marketplace by providing a quality and cost-effective service, and by collaborating with clients on technical solutions. FosRich partners with large global brands seeking local distribution such as Huawei, Philips Lighting, Victron Energy, Siemens, NEXANS and General Electric. FosRich has a staff complement of over one hundred and seventy (170) persons across nine (9) locations in Kingston, Clarendon, Mandeville, and Montego Bay. FosRich also has a team of energy and electrical engineers who offer technical advice and install solar energy systems, solar water heaters and electrical panel boards.

Income Statement
Income
Year-to-date income was $2,863 million, compared to $2,578 million for the prior reporting period. An increase of $285 million. Gross Profit for the year-to-date is $1,082 million compared to $1,118 million for the prior reporting period. The increase in income was attributed primarily to increased sales in ten (10) of our twelve (12) Product Groups. The decrease in Gross Profit was driven by a 54% reduction in Industrial products and a 21% reduction in Panels.

During the second quarter the company generated income of $839 million compared to $779 million for the prior reporting period, representing an increase of $60 million.

Administration Expenses
Administration expenses for the year-to-date was $781 million, reflecting an increase of $169 million on the prior reporting period amount of $612 million. The changes were driven primarily by increased staff related costs for salary adjustments, increased sales commission due to improved sales performance and improvements in staff benefits; increased travelling and motor vehicle expenses; increased insurance costs due to increases in policy renewal rates and increased depreciation due to increases in the carrying values of property plant and equipment, increased professional fees, increased rent and increased security cost.

Finance Cost
Finance cost for the year-to-date was $152 million compared to $127 million for the prior reporting period, an increase of $25 million. This increase is being driven primarily by increases in Bond renewal rates and increases in bank financing.

Operating Profit
Operating Profit generated for the period was $154 million, compared to the $388 million reported for the prior reporting period.

Earnings Per Stock Unit
Earnings per stock unit was 3 cents, compared to the 8 cents reported for the prior reporting period.

Balance Sheet
Inventories
The company continues to proactively manage inventory balances and the supply-chain, with a view to ensuring that inventory balances being carried are optimised, relative to the pace of sales, the time between the orders being made and when goods become available for sale, to avoid both overstocking and stock-outs. Monitoring is both at the individual product level and by product categories. Inventories have remained stable over both periods. Shipping delays experienced in the prior period did not have a significant impact on the results for the current year.

Receivables
We continue to actively manage trade receivables with an emphasis being placed on balances over 180 days. We have implemented strategies to collect these funds as well as to ensure that the other buckets are managed. Fifty-six percent (56%) of receivables are within the current to 60-day category, down from the sixty percent (60%) for the prior reporting period. Receivables also include advance payments made to foreign suppliers for the increasing levels of inventories required to support increasing sales.

Trade Payables
Our trade payables are categorised by foreign purchases, local purchases and other goods and services. We have concentrated primarily on the foreign payables as the bulk of our inventories are sourced from overseas. We continue to manage payables, for the most part, within the terms given by our suppliers.

Non-current Liabilities
Non-current liabilities reflect a net increase of $641 million. This increase is caused primarily by the secured and unsecured bonds, which were current at year end, but have now been refinanced.

Liquidity
At balance sheet date the excess of current assets over current liabilities amounted to $1,861 million (31 December 2022 - $1,235 million), with an improvement in the ratio to 2.52:1, up from 1.69:1 at 31 December 2022. It is expected that FosRich will continue to be able to generate sufficient cash to meet obligations when they fall due. Liquidity is provided primarily from sales revenues and loan financing.

Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity now stands at $2,043 million, up by $258 million from $1,785 million on 31 December 2022. The increase arose primarily as a result of retained profits for the year amounting to $135 million and the proceeds from the issue on new shares amounting to $130 million.

We now have 5,459 shareholders, an increase of 373 or 7% on the 5,086 on 31 December 2022.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Judgment is required in the estimating of expected credit loss for trade receivables, and an appropriate model to predict this loss, based on historic trends is being used. We do not anticipate any notable change in the assumptions underlying the model, or the credit behaviour of our customers.

Other Matters
New Activities
Construction of our new FosRich Superstore & Corporate Offices at 76 Molynes Road has commenced. The completion date is projected to be Q2, 2024.

As we continue to implement our strategic plans, and the plans for expanding into our new store, we continue to execute strategies to expand key product lines, and to drive our export thrust. To address some of the challenges being faced we continue to seek out talented individuals with specialised training and product knowledge, to help in driving growth, and to assist in delivering on our plans for the ensuing period. We will continue to execute on our plans to ensure that we remain competitive and deliver value solutions to our customers.

As we report on the performance of our Company, we thank our shareholders, employees, customers, and other stakeholders for their support as we continue to expand our business and bring greater value to our various stakeholders.

Accounting Policies
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements have remained unchanged since the last audit and the account classifications have also remained the same. Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that became effective after 1 January 2023 have been evaluated and will have no significant effect on the amounts and disclosures in these financial statements.
