INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Members of
138 Student Living Jamaica Limited

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 138 Student Living Jamaica Limited and its subsidiary (the group) and the financial statements of 138 Student Living Jamaica Limited standing alone (the company) set out on pages 15 to 50, which comprise the group and the company's statement of financial position at 30 September 2021, and the group and company's statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the company as at 30 September 2021, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Jamaican Companies Act.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter - Impact of COVID-19

We draw attention to note 30 which refers to the impact of COVID-19 on the group's operations and indicates that the operations have been impacted unfavourably by COVID-19. Management is unable to determine reliably estimate of the financial impact of COVID-19 events on its profitability and financial position for the period subsequent to reporting date, however, management believes that the measures implemented to mitigate the impact on the operations are well positioned to overcome the current challenges brought about by the pandemic. Additionally, subject to the conditions in the Concession Agreement governing the relationship with the University of the West Indies there is a 90% occupancy guarantee for the provision of accommodation. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Valuation of Financial Asset - Service Concession Rights Classified as Fair Value through other comprehensive income

[see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for management’s related accounting policies and disclosures]

Financial asset - service concession rights is carried at fair value, based on triennial valuation by a professional qualified valuator and in the intervening periods by the directors. For the year ended 30 September 2021, the valuation was done by the Allison Pitter & Company, with a resulting fair value of $7.01B for 138 Student Living Limited and $1.5B for 138 SL Restoration Limited. The surplus or deficit is taken to other comprehensive income.

Allison Pitter & Company uses an investments approach via a discounted cash flow as its valuation methodology. The projected net income and a discounted cash flow of those likely net income are taken account of, along with various assumptions. The magnitude and materiality of this balance, the complexity of the models used, the use of management assumptions and the potential for misstatement from the use of inappropriate yields caused us to focus on this balance.

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter

1) We assessed Allison Pitter & Company valuation techniques by using our own internal valuation consultants, who examined the basis and assumptions and analysed the results in detail to assess reasonableness of the fair value amount obtained.

2) We assessed the work of the valuation specialist engaged by management and its production of a valuation report. As well as, evaluate the valuator’s qualifications to determine that there was possession of sound reputation, independence and the necessary skills and/or knowledge to estimate the fair value.

3) We obtained an understanding of the nature of the work performed by management, the objective and the scope as well as understanding and assessing the methods and assumptions used thus determining the appropriateness of the valuation method used to estimate the fair value.

4) We recalculated the amounts disclosed for fair value of the group’s and the company’s financial asset-service concession rights for mathematical accuracy.

5) We further checked that the required disclosures were done in the financial statements, as well as the appropriateness of the reporting of the transactions.

Based on the audit procedures performed, no adjustments to the financial statements were deemed necessary.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d)

Expected credit losses in relation to financial assets.

See notes 3(i)(iii), 5(c)(ii) and 17 to the financial statements for management’s related policies and disclosures.

The determination of expected credit losses ('ECL') on financial assets is highly subjective and requires management to make significant judgement and estimates involving the application of a forward looking expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model, which takes into account reasonable and supportable forward looking information and will result in the earlier recognition of impairment provisions. These estimates involve increased judgment as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the group’s financial assets. The most significant impact of the implementation of the impairment model is to the provisioning policy for the group’s trade receivables. The group estimates expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience. Customers were placed in aging buckets and a default risk percentage calculated using the incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts, the credit history, risk profile of each customer and the aging of receivables.

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

• The group’s accounting policy as it relates to the impairment provision for trade receivables was obtained and the reasonableness of the accounting policy assessed in relation to the requirements of the standard.

• We established an understanding of management’s ECL model including source data, the effectiveness of the implementation and the mathematical accuracy of the model. We tested the reliability of the source data used in the design of the model by confirming a sample to the historical data.

• We tested manual and automated controls over the aging of receivables. Our testing of automated controls involved using our own information technology specialist to test the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the automated controls.

• We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and judgement in arriving at the forward looking multiple, by assessing the basis of the multiple economic scenarios used and the weighting assigned by management.

• We determined whether the default risk percentage was reasonably calculated and correctly applied to the relevant buckets of accounts receivable.

Based on the audit procedures performed, no adjustments to the financial statements were deemed necessary.

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Annual Report but does not include the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.

Our opinion on the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the Jamaican Companies Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group and the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the group’s and the company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

To the Members of

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group and the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that presents a true and fair view.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on additional matters as required by the Jamaican Companies Act

We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, proper accounting records have been kept, so far as appears from our examination of those records, and the financial statements, which are in agreement therewith, give the information required by the Jamaican Companies Act, in the manner required.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Balvin Vanriel.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and action, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.

New, revised and amended standards and interpretations that became effective during the year

The group has adopted the following new and amended standards and interpretations as of 1 October 2020:

Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The revised Conceptual Framework will be used in standard-setting decisions with immediate effect; however, no changes will be made to any of the current accounting standards. Entities that apply the Conceptual Framework in determining accounting policies will need to consider whether their accounting policies are still appropriate under the revised Framework.

There was no impact from the adoption of this amendment.

Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and IAS 8, ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). These amendments and consequential amendments to other IFRSs result in the use of a consistent definition of materiality throughout IFRSs and the Conceptual Framework Reporting. They clarify the explanation of material and also incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)

New, revised and amended standards and interpretations that became effective during the year (cont’d)

Amendments to IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, IFRS 16 Leases, (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). These amendments provide certain reliefs in connection with interest rate benchmark reform. The reliefs relate to hedge accounting and have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the income statement. Given the pervasive nature of hedges involving IBOR based contracts, the reliefs will affect companies in all industries.

The adoption of the above standards and interpretations did not have any material impact on the group’s financial statements.

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted

The following new standards, amendments and interpretation which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the group’s future financial statements:

Amendments to IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ - Covid-19 related rent recessions - Extension of the practical expedient (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021). As a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, rent concessions have been granted to lessees. Such concessions might take a variety of forms, including payment holidays and deferral of lease payments. On 31 March 2021, the IASB published an additional amendment to extend the practical expedient from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2022. Lessees can elect to account for such rent concessions in the same way as they would if they were not lease modifications. In many cases, this will result in accounting for the concession as variable lease payments in the periods(s) in which the event or condition that triggers the reduced payment occurs. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the group.

Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ on Classification of Liabilities (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023). These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’, clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the expectation of the entity or events after the reporting date (for example, the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The amendment also clarifies what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. The group will assess the impact of future adoption of this amendment on its financial statements.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted (cont’d)

Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). This amendment prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, the entity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. It also clarifies that an entity is ‘testing whether the asset is function properly’ when it assesses the technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset is not relevant to this assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities. The group will assess the impact of future adoption of this amendment on its financial statements.

Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 cycle (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). These amendments include minor changes to the following applicable standards:

(i) IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ amendment clarifies that - for the purpose of performing the ’10 per cent test’ for derecognition of financial liabilities - in determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf.

(ii) IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ amendment removes the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements.

The group is assessing the impact the amendment will have on its 2022 financial statements.

(b) Basis of consolidation

Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements presents the results of the company and its subsidiary (“the group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.

(c) Foreign currency translation

Foreign currency transactions pertaining to rental income were accounted for at a fixed exchange rate JA$145 to US$1.

All other foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(c) Foreign currency translation (cont’d)

Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated to Jamaican dollars using the closing rate as at the reporting date.

Exchange differences arising from the settlement of transactions at rates different from those at the dates of the transactions and unrealized foreign exchange differences on unsettled foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognized in profit or loss.

(d) Provisions

Provisions are recognized when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.

(e) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis at such rates as will write off the carrying value of the assets over the period of their expected useful lives. Annual rates of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Motor vehicles</th>
    <th>5 years</th>
  </tr>
</table>

Gains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts and are taken into account in determining surplus or deficit.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(f) Impairment of non-current assets

Other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the greater of an asset’s net selling price and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identified cash flows.

(g) Current and deferred income taxes

Current tax charges are based on taxable profits for the year, which differ from the profit before tax reported because taxable profits exclude items that are taxable or deductible in other years, and items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated at tax rates that have been enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to be paid or recovered on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax bases.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

(h) Revenue recognition

Revenue comprises long and short term rental income and income generated from the sub letting of space to provide services for the benefit of the hall as well as foreign exchange differences.

Revenue from the provision of rental services is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis unless collectability is doubtful.

(i) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity in another entity.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D):

(i) Financial instruments (cont’d)

Financial assets

(i) Classification

The group classifies all its financial instruments at initial recognition based on their contractual terms and the business model for managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value, except in the case of financial assets recorded at FVPL, transaction costs are added to, or subtracted from, this amount.

The group classifies its financial assets as those measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.

Amortised cost

These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (eg. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

The group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables, short term deposits and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

The group has made an irrevocable election to classify its investments at fair value through other comprehensive income rather than through profit or loss as the group considers this measurement to be the most representative of the business model for those assets. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve. Upon disposal any balance within fair value through other comprehensive income reserve is reclassified directly to retained earnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss.

Fair value through other comprehensive income are financial asset - service concession rights derived from service concession agreements and are not quoted in an active market.

(i) Classification (cont’d)

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) (cont’d)

The terms of the concession agreements requires the company to design, finance, construct and operate 2,306 units for student accommodation. Under the first Concession Agreement UWI has guaranteed a minimum of 90% occupancy of available rooms in any 51 weeks period for as long as the Concession Agreement is in place, which is currently estimated to be a minimum of thirty (30) years and a maximum of sixty-five (65) years.

Under the second Concession Agreement UWI has guaranteed a minimum of 90% occupancy of available rooms for 38 weeks and 51 weeks respectively for 650 rooms and 72 rooms of the 722 rooms to be developed under this concession for as long as the Concession Agreement is in place, which is currently estimated to be thirty (30) years to a maximum of thirty- five (35) years.

Under both concessions, the units will be returned to UWI at the end of the term of the sub-lease free of cost. The duration of the lease is equal to the duration of the Concession Agreement.

The service concession rights as described above has been classified as a financial asset.

Financial asset - service concession rights is carried at fair value, based on triennial valuations by a professionally qualified valuer and the intervening periods by the directors. These revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve.

(ii) Recognition and Measurement

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized on the trade-date - the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

(i) Financial instruments (cont’d)

Financial assets (cont’d)

(ii) Recognition and Measurement (cont’d)

The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.

(iii) Impairment

Impairment provisions for trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses (ECL).

During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed by taking into consideration historical rates of default for each segment of trade receivables as well as the estimated impact of forward looking information. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime ECL for the trade receivables. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within the statement of profit or loss. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.

Financial liabilities

The group’s financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At the reporting date, the following items were classified as financial liabilities: trade payables, redeemable preference shares and long and short term loans.

(j) Receivables

Trade receivables are carried at original lease agreement amount. Other receivables are stated at amortised cost.

(k) Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.

(l) Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributed to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity.

(m) Investment in subsidiary

Investment in subsidiary is stated at cost.

(n) Preference shares

Preference shares are classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the stockholders, or if dividends are not discretionary. Dividends thereon are recognised as interest in construction in progress and in the profit or loss upon completion of construction. The group’s redeemable preference shares are redeemable on specific dates, and bear entitlements to distributions that are cumulative and not at the discretion of the directors. Accordingly, they are presented as financial liability.

(o) Borrowings and borrowing costs

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost.

Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of the qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of qualifying assets is deducted from borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

(p) Dividend distribution

Dividend distribution to the group’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the group’s shareholders. In the case of interim dividends, this is recognised when declared by the directors.

(q) Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and meet expenses; whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and for which discrete financial information is available. The CODM has been identified as The Board of Directors in particular the executive members, who make strategic decisions.

Based on the information presented to and reviewed by the CODM, the entire operations of the company are considered as one operating segment.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES:

Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

(a) Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies

In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies relating to recognition of the obligation of the University of the West Indies (UWI), as Grantor, in respect of its guarantee of 90% occupancy of the housing unit provided under the Concession Agreement, management has sought legal opinion on whether occupancy by groups and students other than ‘Students’ as defined in the Concession Agreement, ought to be included in measuring the extent to which the occupancy guarantee has been satisfied.

The legal opinion indicates that groups and students not included in the definition of ‘Students’ and which were sourced by the group independently of UWI should not be included in the calculation. Management has proceeded in recognizing revenue related to the 90% occupancy guarantee on that basis.

(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

(i) Fair value estimation

A number of assets and liabilities included in the group’s financial statements require measurement at, and/or disclosure of fair value.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market price is used to determine fair value where an active market (such as a recognized stock exchange) exists as it is the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument.

The fair value measurement of the group’s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable inputs and data as far as possible. Inputs used in determining fair value measurements are categorized into different levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique are.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT’D):

(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont’d)

(i) Fair value estimation (cont’d)

The standard requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level using the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The classification of an item into the above level is based on the lowest level of the inputs used that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement of the item.

Transfers of items between levels are recognised in the period they occur.

The group measures financial instruments at fair value -

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are deemed to be determined as follows:

(i) The face value, less any estimated credit adjustment, for financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are estimated to approximate their fair values. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and bank balances, receivables, payables, redeemable preference shares and short term loan.

(ii) The carrying value for financial asset - service concession rights is based on fair value using a revenue base approach.

The carrying value of long term liabilities approximates their fair values, as these loans are carried at amortised cost reflecting their contractual obligations and the interest rates are reflective of current market rates for similar transactions.

(ii) Income taxes

Estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The company recognizes liabilities for possible tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were originally recorded, such differences will impact income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT’D):

(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont’d)

(iii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance

The measurement of the expected credit loss (ECL) allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses). Significant judgement is also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as:

• Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk;
• Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL
• Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of product/market and the associated ECL; and
• Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.

(iv) Financial asset-service concession rights

Financial asset-service concession rights is carried in the statement of financial position at market value. The group uses independent qualified appraisers to value the financial asset-service concession rights triennial and the intervening periods by the directors. The valuation approach takes into consideration various assumptions and factors including; the level of current and future occupancy rent rates, a discount rate and inflation rate. A change in any of these assumptions and factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of the financial asset-service concession rights.

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT:

The group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:

- Credit risk
- Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
- Foreign exchange risk
- Other market price, and
- Liquidity risk

In common with all other businesses, the group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks to minimize potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the group and the methods used to measure them.

There have been no substantive changes in the group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.

(c) Financial risk factors

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the determination of the group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the group’s finance function. The Board provides policies for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investments of excess liquidity.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:

(i) Market risk

Market risk arises from the company’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).

Currency risk

Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Currency risk arises from US$ foreign currency cash and cash equivalents. The group manages this risk by ensuring that the net exposure in foreign assets and liabilities is kept to an acceptable level by monitoring currency positions. The group further manages this risk by maximizing foreign currency earnings and holding net foreign currency assets.

Foreign currency sensitivity

The following table indicates the sensitivity of profit before taxation to changes in foreign exchange rates. The change in currency rate below represents management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis represents outstanding foreign currency denominated cash and bank and short term deposits accounts adjusts their translation at the year-end for 8% (2020 - 6%) depreciation and a 2% (2020 - 2%) appreciation of the Jamaican dollar against the various currencies. The changes below would have no impact on other components of equity.

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT’D):

(c) Financial risk factors (cont’d)

(i) Market risk (cont’d)

Price risk

Price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The group does not have a significant exposure and as such, market price fluctuations are not expected to have a material effect on the net results or stockholders’ equity.

Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

Floating rate instruments expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas fixed rate instruments expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.

The group’s short term deposits are due to mature within 12 months of the reporting date, while the group’s long term loan are reprice within 6 months of the reporting date.

Interest rate sensitivity

There is no significant exposure to interest rate risk on short term investments, as these deposits have a short term to maturity and are constantly reinvested at current market rates. There is no significant exposure on the long term loan within the short term.

(ii) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit risk arises from trade receivables, short term deposits and bank balances.

Receivables

Revenue transactions in respect of the group’s primary operations are settled in cash. For its operations done on a credit basis, the group has policies in place to ensure that sales of services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.

(c) Financial risk factors (cont’d)

(ii) Credit risk (cont’d)

Cash and bank balances

Cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Maximum exposure to credit risk

The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of receivables, short term deposits and cash and bank balances in the statement of financial position.

Trade receivables expected credit losses

The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are based on the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model. The guiding principle of the ECL model is to reflect the general pattern of deterioration or improvement in the credit quality of financial instruments.

For trade receivables and contract assets that do not have a financing component, it is a requirement of IFRS 9 to recognize a lifetime expected credit loss. This was achieved in the current year by the development and application of historical data relating to trade receivables and write-offs, as well as forecasting payment probabilities based on historical payment pattern.

The trade receivables were analyzed in compliance with IFRS 9 and the amount presented in the financial statements appears reasonable and in compliance with the required standard.

The group estimates expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience. Based on the incurred loss analyses over delinquent accounts, the credit history, risk profile of each customer and aging of receivables, customers were placed in aging buckets and a default risk percentage calculated for each bucket of customers. The following table provides information about the ECLs for trade receivables as at 30 September.

(d) Capital management

The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for stockholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the group defines as net operating income, excluding non-recurring items, divided by total stockholders’ equity. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to stockholders.

There are no particular strategies to determine the optimal capital structure. There are also no external capital maintenance requirements to which the group is subject.

(a) Both 138 Student Living and 138 SL Restoration constructed and renovated properties and purchased furniture and fixtures. The properties are professionally valued every three years and by directors in the intervening years. The resulting valuations at 30 September 2021 were fair valued at $7.009B for 138 Student Living Limited and $1.504B for 138 SL Restoration Limited. The surplus or deficit arising was taken to other comprehensive income.

(b) The valuation methodology employed for the assessment of the fair value of the subject is an investment approach via a discounted cash flow where the following are undertaken:

Firstly a projection of net income over the proposed periods of the Concession Agreements to determine the likely termination dates of these Agreements - as per the achievements of a net IRR’s on which they are predicated, is undertaken; and

Secondly a DCF is undertaken of those likely net incomes over the projected terms for both agreements in order to establish the fair value of each.

Specific Valuation Assumptions:

In the analysis undertaken the following assumptions are made:

• A rental growth factor of 1.5% to 2.5% per annum is assumed, as the subject types of accomodation generally do not show better rental growth overtime locally and are tied to a US dollar denomination already making it fairly unstable in Jamaican dollar terms;

• Given the current levels of rentals and occupancies achieved, it is assumed that no further development of the balance of rooms as per the agreement will be executed in the foreseeable future.

13. FINANCIAL ASSET - SERVICE CONCESSION RIGHTS (CONT’D):

Specific Valuation Assumptions (Cont’d):

• Expenses are projected to grow at an anticipated rate of 3.2% per annum - in line with a stabilised long term rate of inflation;

• The projected period for an after tax 15% and 12.5% IRR for Concessions Agreements 1 and 2 respectively was assessed at 30 and 21 years, respectively;

• Discount rate of ranging between 8.56% and 10% are used for the relevant cash flows as against current institutional investor target rates of 7% to 8.5% for more traditional investment real estate. Student housing tends to show lower growth rates in terms of income but are fairly stable and offer earnings that often run ‘less cyclical’ in their performance to more traditional investment properties, hence having the effect of reducing the ‘overall risk’ in real estate portfolios.

• The income that is capitalised is the net operating income from the property, which does not include taxes (except property tax where relevant) interest on loans, depreciation or appreciation.

The World Health Organization declared the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The pandemic and the measures to control its human impact have resulted in disruptions to economic activities and business operations. This could have negative financial effects on the group, depending on factors such as the duration and spread of the outbreak, the effects on the economy overall and the effects on the financial markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be estimated reliably.

In its response to the COVID-19 global crisis, the Management of 138SL has taken the necessary steps to align the business within the current realities. These actions include but are not limited to

i. Consolidation of accommodation to house the remaining students on one building of each Halls of Residence, thus reducing utility and staff costs (primarily security and housekeeping which forms our largest staff classification);

ii. Overall reduction of staff costs between 7%; Management has done two redundancy exercise.

iii. Deferral of capital expenditure plans for the rest of the financial year.

iv. Minimize maintenance activities to only essential services.

v. Seeking new opportunities for new sources of revenue during the COVID-19 period by engaging the Government of Jamaica for housing the repatriated Jamaican citizens.

vi. Discussions have been held with bankers and financers to ensure that the group can sustain the business operation throughout this period.

vii. For the 2021 financial year the Covid-19 pandemic had a negative impact on occupancy and revenues. During the period, occupancy recovered from below 20% in the prior year to an average of 36% during the current financial year.
